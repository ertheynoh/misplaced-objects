    <h1>writing in plain text</h1>
      <p>I think it's worth it to write in <a
      href="https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown"
      >plain text</a> because it keeps your writing medium highly
      portable and allows you to automate things like formatting and citations.
      <a href="https://commonmark.org/help/">Markdown</a> is nice
      because it doesn’t require dealing with a whole sophisticated markup
      language while you're just trying to get ideas down. You can use a simple
      plain text editor for any writing project without having to tweak
      formatting or mess around with little menus every time you sit down to
      write.</p>
      <p>I just use the text editor vim and the document converter pandoc to do
      pretty much all of my writing now. In my .vimrc configuration file I have
      “filetype plugin on” and I have it configured so that my textwidth is set
      to 80 characters when I write markdown files (<a
      href="https://vimhelp.org/autocmd.txt.html">:h
      autocmd</a>). This helps keep the text file itself readable even before
      it's been typeset, or if I want to work on it on a machine where I don't
      have my vim configurations. I use the ‘gwap’ command to keep the
      paragraphs nicely formatted and legible, and have a shortcut for it (<a
      href="https://vimhelp.org/change.txt.html#gq">:h
      gq</a>).</p>
      <p>I use <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html"
      >pandoc</a> with Latex and biblatex, so I maintain a bibtex
      <a href="https://youtu.be/GAVXVkcpbG0">database</a>. I
      don’t have zotero. I just use vim to edit the file semi-automatically and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/grep">grep</a> when I want
      to recall a “cite key.” I also have a “snippets” subdirectory in my .vim
      folder, which has little templates like this one:</p>
	<pre>
	  <code>@book{,
	    title = {},
	    author = {},
	    translator = {},
	    date = {},
	    publisher = {},
	    location = {}
	  }</code>
	</pre>
      <p>I can print this template into my .bib database whenever I want to add
      a new entry with a quick keyboard shortcut:</p>
	<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;bk :-1read
	$HOME/.vim/snippets/book&lt;CR&gt;f,i</code></pre>
      <p>I borrowed the idea from <a href="https://youtu.be/XA2WjJbmmoM?t=2300"
      >here</a>.</p>
      <p>Pandoc’s citation preprocessor defaults to Chicago author-date, but you
      can tell it to use any citation style you need using a CSL file (you can
      find some <a href="https://editor.citationstyles.org/about/"
      >here</a>). I handle all my formatting with a <a
      href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block"
      >“YAML header”</a> at the beginning of the file, which I
      also have a “snippet” for:</p>
	<pre>
	  <code>
	  ---
	  geometry: margin=1in
	  indent: true
	  fontfamily: times
	  fontsize: 12pt
	  csl: /home/path/to/chicago-note-bibliography.csl
	  bibliography: /home/path/to/library.bib
	  header-includes:
	    - \usepackage{setspace}
	    - \doublespacing
	    - \usepackage{etoolbox}
          - \patchcmd{\quote}{\rightmargin}{\leftmargin 1.5e			\rightmargin}{}{}
	    - \AtBeginEnvironment{quote}{\singlespacing}
	  ---
	  </code>
	</pre>
      <p>Calling the LaTeX “setspace” and “etoolbox” packages like I do here
      gives me proper Chicago formatting, with double-spaced body paragraphs and
      single-spaced half-inch indented block quotes (I got the tip from <a
      href="https://pandoc-discuss.narkive.com/5sgPR1mh/single-spaced-block-quotes-in-a-double-spaced-latex-pdf"
      >here</a>). The nice thing about the "snippet" is that I
      don't have to memorize all this stuff, or worry about formatting or
      keeping a bibliography when I'm writing. When I want a formatted document,
      I can either paste this snippet at the top of the file or keep it in a
      separate .yaml file. When I call pandoc with the 'C' flag, all the
      formatting and citations will be taken care of for me:</p>
	<pre><code>:! pandoc -C % metadata.yaml -t pdf -o this_text.pdf</code></pre>
      <p>Typing ‘:!’ allows me to invoke pandoc (or any other commandline
      program or shell command) without leaving vim. In my experience pandoc
      works most smoothly as a kind of "Latex for dummies," but I've found it
      pretty serviceable for producing .docx and HTML files as well.</p>
      <p>I’m trying to keep my files simpler for this chapter, since I don’t
      have to worry about migrating to a new workflow with a half-finished
      Microsoft Word document this time around. I’m trying to avoid excessive
      footnoting. When I cite something it just looks like this:</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p class="markdown-block">In the earlier essay, Freud had already
	  begun to notice that the problem of melancholia hinged on questions of
	  identification: &quot;In mourning it is the world which has become
	  poor and empty,&quot; he observed, &quot;in melancholia it is the ego
	  itself.&quot;[@SE14, 246]</p>
	</blockquote>
      <p>...and since my .csl file has pandoc return my citations as footnotes,
      anything in the bracket will show up in its respective footnote
      accompanied by the properly formatted citation. If I really need to write
      a more extensive commentary and want it out of the way of the ‘source’
      file’s main body, I can still just use the regular Markdown syntax:
      [^1].</p>
      <p>This set up seems to lend itself to keeping things a bit more
      organized, doesn’t involve as much formatting during the actual writing
      process, and automates the management of my citational apparatus. Vim did
      take me some time to get the hang of, but I like it more than the
      graphical word processors I used before because it has fewer distractions
      and lots of useful little tricks up its sleeve.</p>
      <p>I've seen some pretty elaborate setups in other people's guides to
      using pandoc and markdown together for academic writing. Some of these are
      very cool, but I didn't want to replace my word processor with ten other
      complicated graphical applications. I also don't want to spend years
      perfecting a vim or emacs configuration to essentially reverse engineer
      Scrivener. I try to keep things in the terminal and to err towards
      simplicity.</p>
