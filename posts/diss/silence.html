<h2 id="so-totally-yours-that-you-must-not-use-it">“So totally yours
that you must not use it”</h2>
<p>Heldris of Cornwall’s <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> is no doubt best
remembered now for its unusual and provocative treatment of gender and
surprising prosopopoeic conflict between Nature and Nurture, but we’re
introduced to the romance’s idiosyncratic narrator through a lengthy
complaint about the avarice of stingy patrons. The poem opens with a
request that the reader burn his verses “rather than share them with the
kind of people / who don’t know a good story / when they hear one,” and
who, perhaps more importantly, are too stingy to appropriately
compensate its author.<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a

tongue-in-cheek plaint takes a special interest in money and

</blockquote>
<p>The moralizing tenor of this prologue doesn’t so much betray a pious
world-weariness as it laments greed as a waste of enjoyment. Money is
worth less than excrement because the hoarder who fetishizes it doesn’t
actually enjoy it: instead of spending his money he is only compelled to
accrue more of it. Those who hoard money do so at the expense of sport,
sexuality, and, most importantly, generosity towards gifted poets.
Instead of expressing contempt for the world, Heldris’ prologue laments
the neglect of earthly pleasures: “I don’t know what to say of those
hateful men / who thus abuse this earthly life – / they have enclosed
their courts with shame forever.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span> Money – and more
specifically, hoarding – is an abuse of the pleasure principle, a
short-circuiting of desire from the objects that normally occasion
it.</p>
<p>If there is any distinction to be made between money and shit, it can
at least be observed that excrement can be usefully enjoyed, say, as a
fertilizer – <em>Li fiens encrasse vials la terre</em>.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> But the hoarder shits on
himself rather than on the earth: “All he does is soil himself [<em>Il
ne fait el fors soi sollier</em>]. / He doesn’t trust his wife any more:
/ he doesn’t want her to spend any of it.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> The hoarder withholds from
circulation what can only have value when given away. He fetishizes his
object, but can’t do so without staining himself. It makes him
incontinent, even impotent. What Freud identified as the hallmarks of
early anal eroticism is certainly at play here, not only in the equation
of money and shit that his writings on the topic are well known for, but
perhaps more importantly for the economy of pleasure and displeasure
that they help bring into view in many medieval texts that are so
preoccupied with the intersection of moral and sexual economy.</p>
<p>In his 1917 essay “On Transformations of Instinct as Exemplified in
Anal Eroticism,”<span class="citation" data-cites="SE17"><a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span> Freud expands upon his
earlier observations on anality<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> to argue that excrement
functions as the child’s first object of desire, preceding the phallus
(and with it the vicissitudes of the castration complex):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defaecation affords the first occasion on which the child must decide
between a narcissistic and an object-loving attitude. He either parts
obediently with his faeces, ‘sacrifices’ them to his love, or else
retains them for purposes of auto-erotic satisfaction and later as a
means of asserting his own will. If he makes the latter choice we are in
the presence of defiance (obstinacy) which, accordingly, springs from a
narcissistic clinging to anal erotism.<span class="citation"
data-cites="SE17"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By describing toilet training as a primal scene in which the subject
makes a choice between a “narcissistic” (or “passive”) and an
“object-loving” (or “active”) attitude, Freud’s heteronormative language
runs into its own limitations. While his argument concerns itself with a
stage of sexual development that precedes the child’s perception of
anatomical difference between the sexes that marks the “phallic stage”
and the castration complex, he might be read as imposing a gender
binary. In opposing an implicitly “masculine” “object-loving attitude”
to a “feminine” narcissism, Freud even characterizes the “faecal mass”
as “the first penis” and likens the rectum to the vagina.<span
class="citation" data-cites="SE17"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></span> The apparent
essentialism of Freud’s terminology may be complicated by the anatomical
situation it describes, however. Because anal eroticism precedes, in his
schema, the child’s erotic fixation on the genitalia, it is not anatomy
alone that determines whether the “passive” or “active” attitude towards
the object will be adopted.</p>
<p>Sexual difference for Freud is phallocentric: the phallus is what
introduces the subject to the very idea of sexual difference in such a
way that it resignifies the objects and economies of pleasure that
preceded the subject’s perception of it. This is not a biologically
essentialist position: for Freud, our anatomies don’t suggest (to the
subject) or determine sexual difference before the subject becomes aware
of it. What Freud’s phallocentric language comes up against here,
though, are the problems of signification that arise in the observation
that, psychically speaking, before the intervention of the phallic
signifier, <em>there is no latent sexual difference</em>: there is no
“male” and “female” unconscious, and there is nothing inherent in a
child’s early relationship with anal sexuality that suggests such a
difference. Freud is of course also interested in the problem of penis
envy in this essay, because it’s during the anal stage that we first
encounter the object as a cause of desire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first they had wanted a penis like a man; then at a later, though
still childish, stage there appeared instead the wish for a baby. […]
The importance of the process described lies in the fact that part of
the young woman’s narcissistic masculinity is thus changed in
femininity, and so can no longer operate in a way harmful to the female
sexual function.<span class="citation" data-cites="SE17"><a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the anality reveals the child’s first object cause of desire to be
the genderless lump of shit, femininity would seem to testify to both a
mobility and a passingness to phallic desire. Though Freud’s
understanding of sexual difference here is hampered by his symbolic
equation of the penis with the phallus,<span class="citation"
data-cites="lacanEcrits"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span> what his
analysis of childhood object choice suggests is a precarious
relationship between sexuality and the body, as “femininity” makes its
appearance not because of an inevitable anticipating equation between
anatomy and sexual disposition but as an imperfect, improvised solution
to a deeper problem of desire. If “exclusive” heterosexuality is a
“problem that needs elucidating” and “not a self-evident fact based on
attraction that is ultimately of a chemical nature”<span
class="citation" data-cites="freudThreeEssays"><a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></span> – if, that is, the “female
sexual function” which is “harmed” by a kind of prior “masculine” mode
of enjoyment isn’t, in fact, “natural” or destined by anatomy – then
what may be so discomfiting to heterosexual masculinity about childhood
anality is the way it reveals narcissistic attachment to the object to
be coextensive with its <em>loss</em>.</p>
<p>Anal eroticism poses a challenge to sexual difference, not because
it’s expressive of some sort of primary femininity or “passivity” but
because it complicates and calls into question what those words signify
in the first place. The child’s attachment to it isn’t rooted in a
desire to be a passive object of someone else’s desire (this would be
the position of the fetishist),<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> but is in fact
defiant, “a means of asserting his own will.” The consequences of “penis
envy” are far more problematic to sexual difference than understanding
it as some sort of caricature of gender difference because what it
suggests is that the thing which the woman knows herself to lack – and
which serves as the anchorpoint of the sex/gender system – is itself
lacking and derivative. By the time it comes into view as a signifier of
sexual difference, Patricia Gherovici notes, “the penis is already
functioning as a substitute,” as a rehearsal of this more primary erotic
situation found in the anal stage.<span class="citation"
data-cites="gherovici2017"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span> It’s for this
reason that for Lacan the first <em>objet a</em> – that is, the object
when it is understood as the occasion for desire – isn’t the penis but
excrement. Anal eroticism defi(l)es the fantasy upon which the so-called
“castration complex” is established: it reveals the basic situation in
which the subject finds itself negotiating its own desire to be
determined not by anatomy alone but by the use we make of it. But as
we’ve seen in the prologue to <em>Silence</em>, excrement has a social
component: I must be taught when to hold it in and when to give it away.
The child must be taught to control its own sphincter. As Gherovici
notes, “the ability to retain feces outlines the child’s dominion of
something that is a part of the body and can be released upon request,”
as a gift, but also as something that is disgusting and abject. It’s in
toilet training, then, that “the child recognizes separation as a major
principle.”<span class="citation" data-cites="gherovici2017"><a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></span> Anality introduces a
dimension of otherness, and with it a primary alienation that precedes
Oedipal symbolization, that is, the introduction of language.</p>
<p>Anal eroticism, then, would seem to speak to a desiring situation
which is in some senses fundamentally scandalous and amoral. I desire
the object, as it were, not only because I lack it but also because I
wish to withhold it from the Other when the Other demands that I give it
to them. It’s through anality that I’m introduced to my desire by way of
an object that is at once intimate and alien (or “extimate”)<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> to me, in a deeply ambivalent
situation where the thing through which I derive satisfaction is at once
an aspect of me (a <em>gift</em>) and not me (an abjection, a lump of
shit). The withholding and letting-go of the object doesn’t directly
translate to two “positions” or “sexes.” Regardless of my anatomical,
endocrinal or chromosomal situation, I am still expected to handle my
shit. Nonetheless, though, as Guy Hocquenghem emphasizes, this
<em>disciplining</em> of anal eroticism is “the precondition of taking
responsibility for property” as well as the grounds on which
homosexuality is repressed: “Your anus is so totally yours that you must
not use it.”<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> If my excrement is extimate to me,
then, my coming to terms with otherness is associated with a
territorialization of my body. I am taught to associate the expulsion of
the object – of the abject – with pleasure and to associate holding it
inside me not only with the withholding of pleasure but also with the
abjection of portions of my own body, that is, with a foreclosure of
certain uses of it.</p>
<p>The prologue to <em>Silence</em> is acutely invested in this erotic
economy. The stingy patron who refuses to give the gift of his shit to
others – whose mode of <em>jouissance</em> isn’t oriented around
sacrificing his object to the Other – ultimately only debases and soils
himself [<em>soi sollier</em>]. By withholding the object from
circulation, he renders it abject. The narrator’s prologue ends with a
concluding complaint about <em>Avarisse</em>, which Heldris apologizes
for, too, in terms of the need to expel a bad object – “I want to get it
all out of my system beforehand [<em>Car jo me voel tost desivrer</em>]
/ so that when it’s time to tell the tale, / there’ll be nothing left in
me to spoil [<em>enpire</em>] the telling.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></span> <em>Desivrer</em>
(<em>des</em> + <em>ivrer</em>) refers to an overcoming or passing over
of intoxication – “to stop being drunk.”<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
It’s this privileging of the moment of division, and of the expulsion of
some intoxicating object, that governs Heldris’ understanding of the
distinction between nature and artifice – or “nurture” – in the rambling
multi-generational tale that comprises his romance. The determination of
what is “natural” is also a dynamic question for Heldris. “Nature” isn’t
an inevitable or static category, but it does have a truth value and it
is sensible: if nature’s truth and moral value is ultimately privileged
over that of nurture or habit, it’s because it’s nature’s repression
that makes it <em>felt</em>, that occasions the demand that it be
embodied.</p>
<p>Though late medieval natural philosophers generally didn’t treat
“nature” and “nurture” (the more common term would have been the
Aristotelian “habit”) as mutually exclusive categories,<a href="#fn20"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>
for Heldris the distinction between them is a central thematic concern.
When it comes to the question of gender, <em>Silence’s</em> ideological
wager ultimately lies not in a supposition that “anatomy is destiny” but
in its attempt to yoke a particular orientation towards enjoyment to
nature. Its central claim about desire is that desire makes itself most
felt when it’s been repressed, and that the objects that occasion it are
coterminous with the desiring subject’s “nature.” To withhold the object
is to repress it – to deny nature – but also to open the door for its
inevitable return. In order to accomplish this, the text has to stage a
repression of nature: in other words, in order to make nature desirable
it must structure itself around a sense of its loss.</p>
<h2 id="perverse-genealogies">Perverse genealogies</h2>
<p>The nostalgic tenor of the prologue’s complaint and the “once upon a
time” opening to the tale itself is entirely conventional to Arthurian
romance – we’re asked to look back to the reign of its King Ebain, a
time when the king’s “rules were not just idle talk” and when good deeds
were not only expected but also rewarded.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></span> What’s remarkable about
<em>Silence</em>, though, is the way the text specifically brings this
nostalgic comportment to bear on the question of its protagonist’s sex,
figuring femininity in the process as a lost object whose return is
continually deferred up until the narrative’s conclusion, when the
protagonist’s “natural” sex is finally restored.</p>
<p>The indeterminacy of Silence’s sex provides the material for the
narrative’s central conflict, and is made into a problem by an event
that occurs before they are even born.<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
When a deadly quarrel breaks out over inheritance rights after two
counts marry a pair of twins and can’t agree upon which of the twins is
the eldest, Ebain, overwhelmed by grief, abolishes female inheritance
altogether.<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span> It’s for this this reason
that Silence’s father, Cador, insists to his new wife Eufemie that their
child be raised as a man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whichever you have, male or female,<br />
you shall have the lady announce to me,<br />
sweet, that you have had a fine son;<br />
let it be announced in the presence of all.<br />
For if we have a daughter,<br />
she won’t get a single shred<br />
of our earthly possessions,<br />
unless we arrange things so<br />
cleverly and secretly that nobody finds out what we’re up to.<br />
We will raise her as a boy,<br />
watch her closely and keep her covered up.<br />
Thus we will be able to make her our heir:<br />
no one will be able to challenge it.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The determination of Silence’s sex here is reliant upon the
linguistic framework of patrilineal inheritance and recognition: so long
as the child’s father thinks the child is a boy, it’s a boy. The plan is
contrived to the point of absurdity, however. When Cador brings up his
concern over inheritance to Eufemie, her initial response is puzzled
indifference: “‘I am not to blame, you know, [<em>En moi, cho savés, n’a
nul blasme</em>] / whether the child is male or female. / God who
created and who watches over mankind / has decreed that the mother
should be happy / and the father pleased with any child.’”<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Cador’s pithy invocation of Paul,<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> and insistence that
they ought “be of one mind [<em>aiens le voloir commun</em>]”<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></span> on this agreement, though,
doesn’t stop him from eventually breaching the terms of his own legal
fiction. Nature quickly goes to work on the child, going out of her way
to create a girl of exceptional beauty (“there is absolutely nothing
wrong with this girl – / except that she’s too beautiful. / […] Nature
will never work so well / on any mortal being again”).<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></span> Once the child is born, the
announcement is made publicly that they’ve given birth to a son, but
Cador finds himself unable to contain his curiosity and asks Eufemie
directly to tell him the child’s sex: “He was in a state of tremendous
uncertainty [<em>moult grant error</em>], / for he didn’t know the truth
/ […] but he himself had caused this doubt […]. / He wanted to know the
truth.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></span> The moment the parents
decide to raise the child as if it were a boy, Nature of course decides
to give them a girl. What’s even more ironic about Cador’s plan, though,
is that it’s as though the purpose of deciding ahead of time to raise
the child <em>as if it were</em> a particular sex were less to ensure
the child’s sex than to ensure that its sex would always be subject to
doubt and uncertainty. On the terms of such an arrangement, even if the
child were born “anatomically male,” its maleness would need to be a
fiction and its “true” sex withheld from the father’s knowledge.</p>
<p>As Zrinka Stahuljak has pointed out, while the “discourse of medieval
genealogy explicitly promotes the primacy of the natural blood relation
between father and son,”<span class="citation"
data-cites="stahuljak2005"><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></span> many literary
narratives of the time show a particular concern with the ways in which
genealogy has less to do with procreation than with language.
“Genealogical filiation,” she argues, “is not natural and sanguine;
instead, it is a denaturalized, because linguistic, relation between
father and son.”<span class="citation" data-cites="stahuljak2005"><a
href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></span> To the extent that he notes
the way in which “literary genealogy” departs from “nature,” Blake
Gutt’s reading of <em>Tristan de Nanteuil</em> rhymes with this
analysis, going a little further when he aligns the “genealogical
imperative” common to the <em>chanson de geste</em> with “queerness” as
such because of the way that narrative’s protagonist changes their sex
as part of a “fulfillment of genealogical necessity.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="gutt2018"><a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></span> <em>Silence</em> is
consistent with other romances contemporary to it in its emphasis on
this linguistic aspect of genealogical filiation. I would argue,
however, that given that its narrative rather bluntly pits nature
against genealogy to the point of satire, <em>Silence</em> puts pressure
on the notion that the opposition between genealogy (which the text is
always ready to remind us is <em>patrilineal</em>) and nature is
equivalent with the contradiction between queerness and gender
normativity.</p>
<p>Heldris doesn’t pretend, for instance, that King Ebain’s abolition of
female inheritance is especially just or noble. It’s a decision he makes
while in a “terrible rage [<em>grant ire</em>],”<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></span> and when he demands that his
nobles swear an oath to follow the decree not all of his nobles are
particularly eager to do so.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> What distinguishes
Cador from his king in this respect though is that he waffles with
respect to his commitment to his own speech act, to uphold it as law.
Cador’s need to know the child’s “natural” sex doesn’t in fact change
his intention to raise the child as a boy; the knowledge of its
“natural” sex instead only prompts him to go to even greater lengths to
maintain the fiction for the rest of the world. He decides outright to
“disguise [<em>desguiser</em>]” the child, “to make a male of a female
[<em>faire en voel malle de femiele</em>]”<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></span> by way of an elaborate plot
to fake the child’s near-death and send it to live in isolation in the
woods with a family confidant. One should note, though, the emphasis
that’s placed on the new plan’s transactionality. Cador assumes that he
can essentially purchase a male heir by paying someone to raise the
child for them in seclusion – “I certainly see nothing wrong / with
rewarding the lady handsomely,” Heldris wryly remarks, “for they will be
getting a boy for a girl, / a little male heir instead of a
daughter.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn36"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></span> The child’s masculinity must
not only be saleable, though. It also needs to be revocable.</p>
<p>The way the narrative lays the groundwork for the confrontation
between Nature and Nurture is to pit what we may want to today call
“gender” against “sex” in such a way that the former is always forcibly
and arbitrarily imposed. The will of the father is such that the child’s
gender is always exchangeable, subject to the wants of the father. Cador
reminds Eufemie that they can’t be sure they’ll ever have a son, but
that in the event that they <em>did</em> they can always “turn this one
back into a girl [<em>Cesti ferons desvaleter</em>].”<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></span> The word Heldris uses here
is <em>desvaleter</em> (literally: to “disboy”)<a href="#fn38"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
which as Michèle Perret notices is a neologistic play on
<em>despuceler</em> – to “disgirl,” that is, to deflower.<span

Watt follows Perret’s post-structuralist emphasis on this line’s
linguistic playfulness (one of many “purs jeux sur le signifiant” to be
found among romances of its kind), finding it significant of “a
remarkable level of flexibility in the formation of gender and the
erotic implications of Silence’s switching between ‘natural’ and
‘unnatural’ gendered positions.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="perret1985 wattCarVallesSui2019"><a href="#fn40"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></span> Watt argues for a reading of
Silence as a transgender man, on the grounds that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he is a character who spends much of the text living as a man and
presents a masculinity based not on genitalia but on his upbringing, his
outlook and decisions, and malleable features of his physiognomy, and
presents a valuable model of a changeable and vulnerable masculinity
that may be best explored by referring to him using masculine
pronouns.<span class="citation" data-cites="wattCarVallesSui2019"><a
href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are strong grounds for such an interpretation, particularly in
those remarkable moments in the text, which I’ll return to later, when
Nature is explicitly pitted against both “Nurture” – a prosopopoeial
figure without precedent in other narratives of the time – and
<em>Reason.</em></p>
<p>What seems to get lost in these kinds of readings, though, is the
extent to which the departure from Nature is occasioned by a perverse
exercise of patriarchal authority: who “dis-boys” the child but the
father? <em>Desvaleter</em> reduces the line between plucking a child’s
virginity and castrating them to a mere slip of the tongue. The
undertone of sexual violence here is somewhat surprisingly overlooked in
these readings, given that the whole scene speaks to the degree to which
Cador’s occupation of the position of patriarch is addled with anxiety,
whether it’s in his inability to resist breaking his own rules to have
absolute certainty of the child’s anatomical sex, or in his elaborate
plans to fake the child’s death and send it off to live in the woods and
be “mis-raised” by a trusted nursemaid.<a href="#fn42"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>

when invoked in the context of how that function is in fact often
embodied – names a futile aspiration. While the (“real”) father seeks to
embody the symbolic function of a mediator, or “happy <em>me-deum</em>
[<em>le juste mi-dieu</em>]” between the mother and child through an
intervention that presents himself as an alternative <em>objet a</em>
for the mother, he rarely succeeds. The failure to embody the function,
however, doesn’t foreclose its pursuit, which helps explain why “there
is nothing worse than a father who proffers the law on everything.”<a

Ebain’s impulsive and over-correcting abolition of female inheritance,
for instance, is echoed by the hysterics Cador and Eufemie go into when
Silence, now a young man, runs off in secret to see the world with a
pair of troubadours. In addition to decreeing that all troubadours found

one),<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn47"

of extreme and disproportionate mourning. Heldris recounts how Cador and
Eufemie’s mourning period is marked by so much swooning that taking care
of them becomes a full-time job for the nobles attending to them, who
are forced to restrain their desire to mourn (<em>refragnent lor
volenté</em>, which Roche-Mahdi translates as “repressing their natural
inclinations”) and refrain from crying out in grief (<em>Eskivent soi de

virtue and restraint against this backdrop of weepy patriarchs. They
check off all the boxes of self-effacing courtly nobility, maybe even
too well. He excels, for instance, at sports<a href="#fn50"

way an interpretive stretch of Watt’s to read Silence as a model of
masculinity in this light when she argues for reading him as trans. I
think it’s important to ask, though, how it is that this transness comes
into view in a poem like <em>Silence</em>: on what terms does gender get
posed as question in the first place? Up to this point I’ve emphasized
the moments in the romance that precede or are more or less anecdotal to
what’s often read as its main plot as a series of scenes in which people
experience some sort of loss that they don’t know quite what to do with
or even what it is they’ve lost. The characters I’ve focused on –
especially the men – commit to doing something about it anyway, and in
the process simply shift the grounds on which loss is felt. They defer
it. Silence, however, doesn’t quite embody that position. Does that make
Silence a “valuable model of a changeable and vulnerable
masculinity”?<span class="citation" data-cites="wattCarVallesSui2019"><a

<p>In an influential essay on <em>Silence</em>, R. Howard Bloch remarks
that the “proper of romance” lies in the “interstices between nature, an
assumed propriety of names, sexual difference, and the rule of
primogenital inheritance, on the one hand, and, on the other, the ruses
of language expressed as artifice or hiding (and including silence),
transgression of grammatical property, sexual inversion, and the
deflection of a proper succession.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="bloch1986"><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"

suggest is that a trans/queer reading practice perhaps ought not be
obligated to either pick a side within this list of antimonies or simply
add more terms to it (like those of the “sex/gender distinction”).<span

<em>Silence</em> in particular, I’d also suggest that such readings
can’t afford to ignore the transgenerational and violently reparative
aspects of the narrative. Is it really the “proper” of a symptomatic
reading, for instance, to write off the poem’s ending – wherein Silence
is “restored” to their “natural” (feminine) sex – as only a “sideshow”
in which the text’s queerness can only be a slip of a larger ideological
agenda?<span class="citation" data-cites="clark2002"><a href="#fn56"

<p>The range of scholarly responses to Silence’s unusual sexuation may
nonetheless be indexical of something that is genuinely problematic and
difficult given the hermeneutic tools available to both our contemporary
moment and Heldris’ for describing aberrant gender positions. It’s in
such a light that the question of how to account for Silence’s gender
may be less interesting than how the <em>Roman de Silence’s</em>
narrative poses the <em>question</em> of gender in the first place. By
attending to some of the ways the romance is punctuated by
<em>loss</em>, I’ve meant to suggest that loss is constituent of how it
poses that question in some important ways. But “loss” isn’t, in itself,
an answer to this more basic question. What I’d like to suggest is that
the grounds by which any reading of Silence’s “gender” (including those
which may make a claim to their “transness”) might take place are in
part established by the ideological commitments of the text’s own
melancholic structure, through which a social and psychological
repression of “femininity” preserves femininity as an essence or lost
object whose recovery is the object of a reparative desire.
<em>Silence’s</em> narrative, then, presents a theory of gender insofar
as it fetishistically presents it as something which exists prior to the
subject and which, having been fantasized as something which that
subject has abandoned, can be restored.</p>
<h2 id="the-melancholic-supplement">The melancholic supplement</h2>
<p>In terms of its avowed narrative commitments, <em>Silence</em> is of
course by no means a “depressive” text. Performative authorial
complaints aside, “the proper of romance,” we might say, has less to do
with consolation than with telling a good story.<span class="citation"
data-cites="bloch1986"><a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></span> But it’s worth remembering
that about a third of the text is concerned with establishing the
staging of the life that concerns that story: the abolition of female
inheritance, the meeting and lengthy courtship of Cador and Eufemie, the
hatching of the plot to raise their child as a boy. I’ve suggested that
this prehistory is to a large extent characterized as a series of
losses, each of which precipitates a deferral or misrecognition of the
object of those losses. By treating its subject’s occupation of an
affective position that is first and foremost shaped by contradiction –
whether between desire and demand or between the subject and its
identifications – as the site of a kind of narrative tension that
necessarily demands a resolution, the romance form can take on a
specific ideological force with respect to questions of sexuation. What
I haven’t addressed, though, is the question of loss itself. What sort
of loss is loss, and in what sense is a narrative or form of desire
“melancholic” when it’s structured around it? In this section, I’d like
to attend to how the text’s understanding of sexual difference depends
on an ideological notion that desire, properly understood, is something
which follows a subject’s “nature,” and suggest that a large part of
such an account relies on a melancholic theory of desire.</p>
<p>If <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> prompts the question of gender it’s
by way of a melancholic conception of desire: Silence’s “natural” gender
position is posited as something which has been <em>lost</em>, whose
absence is felt in diffuse and indirect ways but often not consciously
identified by Silence themself, at least not with absolute certainty. In
the next section I will spend some time dwelling in this sense of
uncertainty that the narrative opens up, but before I get to that I
think it’s important to explain what I mean by this sense of loss, as
well as the sense in which desire itself is melancholic in both medieval
philosophical and modern psychoanalytic thought. Like sodomy,
melancholia is a sin centered on questions of what constitutes proper
enjoyment, marking the point at which the consequences of my mode of
enjoyment becomes problematic to my adaptation to the world. The object
of melancholia is more elusive, however.</p>
<p>For Freud the difficulty of melancholia lies in the way loss appears
to be something of an enigma. Karl Abraham had ventured in 1911 to
explain “neurotic depression” in terms of a subject’s resignation of
gratification: “A neurotic will be attacked with anxiety when his
instinct strives for a gratification which repression prevents him from
attaining; depression sets in when he has to give up his sexual aim
without having attained gratification.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="abrahamselected"><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a></span> By the time
Freud turns to the subject in “Mourning and Melancholia,” though, he’s
noticed a difference between those subjects whose symptoms could be
attributed to a loss that was conscious – the grief over losing a loved
one, or even for a time in which things were different – and those for
whom it could not. Even in those cases where a conscious cause for
grieving could be found, the significance of what had been lost wasn’t
self-evident: “He knows <em>whom</em> he has lost but not <em>what</em>
he has lost in him.”<span class="citation" data-cites="SE14"><a
href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></span> The distinction ultimately
hinges on identification: “in mourning it is the world which has become
poor and empty; in melancholia it is the ego itself,” as the thing which
has been lost – and around which strong feelings of both love and hatred
have gathered – is unconsciously identified with.<span class="citation"
data-cites="SE14"><a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></span></p>
<p>If this all sounds rather abstract it’s because melancholia doesn’t
have one form or cause: the problem Freud begins from is the question of
why there are those who demonstrate many of the same symptoms of someone
who has experienced some great tragedy or loss but doesn’t themself know
what the cause of those feelings may be. Depression may begin from
grieving but it isn’t identical with it. It helps to describe when the
perfectly “normal” response to some sort of loss becomes “pathological,”
that is, when it persists beyond the reckoning with loss itself (“real”
or otherwise) and may even become deadly. The melancholic ego is an open
wound and a libidinal vacuum: it confronts us with the possibility that
loss may not be all there is to loss. When my affective investment in my
object – necessarily ambivalent – has nowhere to go upon losing (or
losing interest in) that object, I turn that investment inwards. The
question of loss now opens out onto questions of identification and the
object itself: if there is a sense in which I “identify” with that
object – that is, incorporate the elements of that object that elicited
such strong feelings into my own ego – we may well wonder if that
“object” is identical with the one that may have been lost or let go of
in the first place.</p>
<p>It’s because melancholia brushes up so closely to questions of
desire, identification, and even pleasure that subjects (and narratives)
often go to very great lengths to avoid it. What Freud called
melancholia’s <em>ambivalence</em> – the way the melancholic
internalizes their repressed scorn for the loved object – offers, I
think, an illustrative case of what Lacan would later refer to as
<em>jouissance</em>. In melancholia enjoyment appears not only as the
“beyond” of pleasure – that is, the point at which physical stimulation
risks tipping over from pleasure into displeasure (as in an orgasm) –
but also reveals itself in the melancholic’s ambivalent attachment to
their own symptoms and to the less dramatic ways a subject might take
pleasure in their own displeasure. In both Abraham and Freud’s early
observations about melancholia we find the observation that the patients
derive a kind of perverse enjoyment of their own suffering.<a
href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> I become habituated to my own
despair; I attach myself to it. It’s the sense of what Lauren Berlant
would perhaps refer to as <em>stuckness</em> that’s of interest here:
the problem of melancholia comes into view alongside the observation
that I may become attached to my own suffering in such a way that it
begins to feel like home, so that to abandon it becomes unthinkable
because it is, in a sense, unbearable.<span class="citation"
data-cites="berlantSex"><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></span> Perhaps this is
why melancholia is, in the middle ages, so strongly associated with
<em>acedia</em>, with sloth generally being understood as not so much a
sin against “work ethic” as of a certain perversion of desire, as a
mismanagement of <em>jouissance</em>.</p>
<p>In the medieval moral imaginary, concerns over money, anality, and
sloth are ultimately economic: what’s at stake for so many texts that
concern themselves with the ethics of these subjects is the question of
how one ought to manage one’s own enjoyment, and the ways in which
falling into and out of sin is less a question of epigenetic causality
or a subject’s failure to conform with a specific model or type than it
is a kind of libidinal balancing act. What these particular anxieties
ask again and again is whether one’s enjoyment of an object that one
doesn’t <em>sacrifice</em> and <em>dis-identify</em> with is really
enjoyment at all. It’s the prickliness of this question that “Nature” is
so often mobilized to smooth over, to provide an anchor point by which a
subject might find its balance. In order to parse the antimony between
“Nature” and “Nurture” (or <em>habitus</em>) in this imaginary, then, I
think it’s important to account for how Nature is already a kind of
supplement to the deeper state of ambivalence and uncertainty that marks
the depressive position.</p>
<p>While by the later middle ages sloth’s “innocent mixture of
unwillingness and laziness” that we may at times be wont to understand
as “a sin against the capitalist work ethic” is certainly something that
we might trace coming into view in such expressions as the fourteenth
century English preoccupation with <em>waste,</em> Giorgio Agamben
reminds us that for the church fathers it named something far
graver.<span class="citation" data-cites="agambenStanzas"><a
href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></span> If the affliction manifests
itself as a “withdrawal from the divine good,” it is because this
“<em>recessus</em> of the slothful does not betray an eclipse of desire
but, rather, the becoming unobtainable of its object: <em>it is the
perversion of a will that wants its object, but not the way that leads
to it, and which simultaneously desires and bars the path to his or her
own desire</em>.”<span class="citation" data-cites="agambenStanzas"><a
href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></span> When, for instance,
Augustine recalls the ways in which his youthful love of the theatre was
connected to a love of suffering – “I was allured all the more by the
actor’s interpretation when it moved me to tears”<span class="citation"
data-cites="augustineRuden"><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a></span> – part of
what’s sinful about this form of <em>jouissance</em> lies in its
banality. Augustine’s appetite for suffering wasn’t for one that would
“penetrate [him] deeply” but for a kind of suffering which would
ultimately amount to an accretion of sickly little pleasures, “a
seething, swelling putrefaction and revolting pus” of sinfulness.<span
class="citation" data-cites="augustineRuden"><a href="#fn66"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a></span> What begins to come into
view in such an account is the precariousness of the relation between
enjoyment and desire: I take pleasure in suffering not because it’s
suffering itself that I desire but because what that suffering occasions
is my continued desiring. It’s here where sin enters the picture:
ultimately, my desire is not, or not only, my own, and if that is the
case than neither is the satisfaction which I withhold in my effort to
continue desiring without end.</p>
<p>The state Lady Philosophy finds Boethius in when she casts out the
poetic muses in the beginning of the <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em>
is not so dissimilar. These “chorus girls” (<em>scenicas
meretriculas</em>), as they are described, substitute reason for the
“useless thorns of passion” (<em>infructuosis affectuum spinis</em>),
habituating the mind to illness rather than liberating it (<em>mentes
assuefaciunt morbo, non liberunt</em>).<span class="citation"
data-cites="boethiusLoeb"><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a></span> The narrator’s
ailment is all the more grave for how comfortable he has become in
occupying it. Melancholia is a <em>habitus</em> that extends beyond
whatever may occasion it, a practice of suffering for its own sake, of
digging one’s own heels into your grief. As the <em>Consolation</em>
continually insists, however, such a state carries with it a
“responsibility,” as Vance Smith puts it, for there “to be something
that resolve[s] or transcend[s] it – that would terminate it.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="smithdying"><a href="#fn68"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a></span> Answering such a demand is
anything but straightforward. The cure for melancholia isn’t to be found
in the mere rejection of suffering in order to aspire towards happiness
and “good” pleasures. In fact, happiness – that is, fortuitous
happiness, the kind that one generally pursues – can be in its own way
cruel and capricious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A]sk of a man who has been having a run of good luck whether he
knows or doesn’t know that it can be taken away. If he doesn’t know,
then he can’t be happy but only ignorant; and if he does know, then he
can’t be happy because he is worried about losing everything at any
moment, and this continual fear will keep him from being happy. Or there
is a third possibility, which is that he thinks it won’t matter when he
loses it all. But in that case, he doesn’t value it very much and
doesn’t care about what he can so calmly imagine losing.<span
class="citation" data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn69"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with pursuing happiness in good fortune is that this sort
of contingent, temporary satisfaction will always be predicated on a
kind of cruel optimism insofar as it is predicated on whether or not one
possesses it, and possession is always accompanied by the possibility
for dispossession. A privileged case for this is money. “Are riches ever
really yours?” Lady Philosophy asks, observing that “money is precious
not when you have it but when it passes on from you to somebody else, in
which case you don’t have it anymore.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a></span> The paradox of
wealth is that we only aim to accumulate it in order to spend it, we can
only enjoy it by losing it.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that a state of total dispossession is desirable or
morally superior, though. The hypothetical existence of a “single man
who had all the money in the world” so that “the rest of mankind would
have to live without it” demonstrates that money “can’t be possessed
without making others poorer.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a></span> The question of
value is also a question of <em>enjoyment</em>: just as the melancholic
goes against nature in refusing the satiation of their own suffering,
the hoarder of wealth accumulates gold at the expense of their own
enjoyment of it, and makes everyone around them impoverished in the
process. In Lady Philosophy’s thought experiment, the existence of even
one person who has abundant wealth while everyone else has none doesn’t
amount to the abolition of money: rather than his money being worthless
because it can’t be <em>exchanged</em>, the presence of wealth is always
accompanied by its own lack. What should be noted in this account,
though, is that this critique of wealth isn’t a critique of money
itself: what’s importantly retained is a sense that there can be such a
thing as a just exchange, and that the existence of money doesn’t in
itself inevitably pave the way for the unequal accumulation of wealth.
It’s possible, that is, to imagine a world in which we all lack
equally.</p>
<p>This dynamic is played out more fully in the dialogue on happiness.
If worldly happiness doesn’t necessarily preclude suffering, it’s
because people go to irrational, self-destructive lengths in order to
pursue it: “we know that many men have looked for happiness even through
pain and suffering. How, then, can this present life make them happy
when the prospect of its end does not make them miserable?”<span
class="citation" data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn72"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a></span> If there’s something cruelly
optimistic about happiness, then, it isn’t our desire for happiness
itself that obstructs our own flourishing – the problem isn’t, in other
words, that happiness is an <em>object</em> of our desire – but rather
that we fetishistically mistake some <em>aspect</em> of happiness for
Happiness qua Happiness. What Boethius grapples with in the first two
books of the <em>Consolation</em> is the ethical impasse that
accompanies just this realization. We may well ask if the mistake of the
melancholic – the <em>morbus mens</em> – is, then, not only in mistaking
fortuitous happiness for Happiness as such, but, moreover, because they
<em>know better than to be happy.</em> In justifiably turning away from
the false and momentary happiness of fortune, the melancholic also casts
out God.</p>
<p>The melancholic situation, then, always demands some sort of
supplement. To the extent that it (like death) can’t ever be thought in
terms of pure negativity or lack, it follows that the notion of a
subject who <em>has no will</em> or who wills their own death is a kind
of aporia, understandable only in terms of logical fallacy or
(self-)deceit. That the depressive position registers an
<em>impasse</em> wherein the subject is opportunely positioned to
discern between the way their desire and their knowledge join hands to
negate that subject is just what makes this impasse so productive for
medieval writers. Melancholia has a <em>telos</em> in the sense that it
produces the terms for its own dissolution, it demands a supplement by
which its impasse can be traversed.</p>
<p>Towards what, though? For Boethius, at least, the endpoint of
consolation is perpetually deferred. As Mark Miller has pointed out, at
the center of the <em>Consolation’s</em> dialectic is its collapse of
two contradictory accounts of action, that is, between an essentially
Aristotelian account according to which “everything an agent pursues is
under the aspect of some good” and a stronger Platonist claim that “all
action aims at one thing, which is ‘the good’ as such.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="miller2004"><a href="#fn73"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></span> It’s this failure to
satisfactorily reconcile these two viewpoints, however, that makes the
<em>Consolation</em> a compelling account of subjectivity, because it’s
precisely in his attempt to conflate these two versions of agency in
accounting for the human capacity for self-destruction that he
introduces a split between will and desire.</p>
<p>One of the more powerful moments where this split comes into view is
in Book III, when upon demonstrating that “everything that exists
endures [<em>manere</em>] and perseveres [<em>subsistere</em>] as long
as it is a unity [<em>quam diu sit unum</em>] but is destroyed as soon
as it ceases to be a unity” Lady Philosophy asks Boethius if, when
acting “naturally,” if any living thing ever “abandons its appetite for
existence and survival.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="boethiusSlavitt boethiusLoeb"><a href="#fn74"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></span> When Boethius denies this,
with the possible exception of “plants or trees or things that are in no
way alive,” Philosophy interjects that the same is true of them too, for
“Nature gives each plant what is appropriate for it and keeps it alive
for as long as possible.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></span> This “love of
survival” unites both willing subjects and the natural world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are talking here not of voluntary motions of intelligent souls
but of the workings of nature, in which we also participate. We digest
the food we have consumed without any conscious thought and we breathe
in our sleep without being aware of what we are doing. Even in living
things, then, the love of survival [<em>manendi amor</em>] is not
something that is willed but a consequence of natural principles.
Indeed, there are times when the will may decide it is better to die,
while nature fears and avoids death. Or although nature always wants it,
there may be occasions when the will decides to refrain from the act of
procreation that perpetuates all mortal things. You see, then, that this
love of self comes not from the will but from nature, as a gift of
providence, so that all things desire to persist and endure for as long
as they can.”<span class="citation" data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a
href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The existence of free will introduces the possibility that the
subject may act against their own desire, which, she explains, is always
a desire for “unity” [<em>Omnia … unum desiderant</em>], which is not
only “the same thing as the good,” but also both the “end and the object
of all things.”<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> The culmination of this argument is
found in the next book – when Lady Philosophy explains that since
everyone desires the Good whether they realize it or not, “the wicked
are actually happier being punished than they would be if there were no

<p>This split between will and desire is necessary for the
<em>Consolation’s</em> dialectic to establish God as both the
<em>telos</em> and <em>object</em> of all desire. That is, in order to
maintain that the subject falls under the swing of what might be read as
an ontologically primary “life drive” – that is, of an erotic “desire to
be one” that inheres to the “love of survival” – it is necessary to
ontologically abolish from “nature” and from <em>desire</em> any
suggestion of a division within desire itself. The subject can
<em>will</em> their own death, but in doing so they are acting contrary
to their own desire and, it follows, against nature and the good: “Nam
saepe mortem cogentibus causis quam natura reformidat voluntas
amplectitur” (the will [<em>voluntas</em>] often, with good cause
[<em>cogentibus causis</em>], embraces death while nature recoils from
it).<span class="citation" data-cites="boethiusLoeb"><a href="#fn79"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a></span> The split between
<em>desiderium</em> and <em>voluntas</em> on the one hand preserves the
rationality of both terms. For even when the will embraces death, it
doesn’t do so without <em>cogentibus causis</em>, that is, without
compelling grounds or cause for doing so. But why should this account of
the will emerge first from an observation about procreation? What’s
striking in this account is the will’s negativity: it appears here in
the act of <em>refraining</em> from procreation, “the act that
perpetuates all mortal things.”</p>
<p>Given the <em>Consolation’s</em> lack of concern with the more
overtly theological entanglements of things like carnal desire and
sinfulness, it’s notable that here there should be some urgency in
establishing an account of the will by introducing a point of divergence
from it and a deeper, more authentic, desire that is coterminous with
the natural imperative to reproduce. I would argue that this is an
important feature of the <em>Consolation’s</em> ideological commitments,
which can also be found is in later medieval texts which more explicitly
deal with questions of gender and sexuality. In a text like Heldris of
Cornwall’s <em>Roman de Silence</em>, for instance, something like a
distinction between sex and gender emerges in such a way that also
ultimately binds them together, marking their divergences from one
another as unnatural. While in <em>Silence</em>, however, part of how
the titular character’s “natural” gender is discerned is through the
plot’s determination that their socialized one forecloses sexual
enjoyment, what’s striking in Lady Philosophy’s account of procreation
is how radically desexualized it is.</p>
<p>This is in stark contrast to a thinker like Augustine, for whom
sexuality, as Willemien Otten has argued, provides a privileged
reference point for understanding sin itself as a “permanent
destabilizing human force.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="ottenmarriage"><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></span> On this
account, the division between carnal and spiritual desire is a point of
productive contradiction. When Augustine confesses to being “in love
with being in love,” for instance, carnal pleasure in a sense serves a
purpose for its inability to provide the satisfaction of divine
eros.<span class="citation" data-cites="augustineRuden"><a href="#fn81"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a></span> As Alenka Zupančič puts it,
sin here inscribes a <em>lack in nature</em>. If we are
<em>naturally</em> compelled to reproduce, the thing that makes the
actual carrying out of this imperative unbearable lies in nature itself:
sex reminds us that “nature lacks something in order to be Nature (our
Other) in the first place.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="zupancicSex"><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a></span> The symptom of
this predicament is the shame that accompanies knowledge. The awareness
of one’s own nakedness – and of the necessity of the sexual act in order
to fulfill this procreative imperative – is itself a reminder of a kind
of loss: “‘knowing the other in the biblical sense’ is to engage with
the point in the Other where knowledge is lacking.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="zupancicSex"><a href="#fn83"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></span> What the
<em>Consolation</em> represses, then, may be just this lack.</p>
<p>For Boethius, though, the division between will and desire speaks to
the myriad ways the subject is prone to misrecognizing or misreading
their own desire. The result is that this constituent negativity is less
characteristic of knowledge than it is of the will. Perhaps this is why
Lady Philosophy only addresses the issue of reproduction by way of a
digression on plants – to address human reproduction would mean locating
negativity within knowledge itself rather than within the will. This may
be where the ideological kernel of the <em>Consolation</em> begins to
come into view: not, perhaps, so much in the explicit unstitching of
sexuality from <em>jouissance</em> as in the unconscious need to
preserve the wholeness of “Nature” as a bedrock of certainty against
which I might discern the truth of my desires. Such an account remains
coherent only so far as sexuality and enjoyment remain outside of the
picture, but it’s in moments like this one when their absence is most
felt. Insofar as the <em>Consolation</em> is a text about discerning
one’s desires, perhaps it’s this elision that allows the text’s
dialectic to take on its curative function in the first place when it
introduces its melancholic supplement in the form of discourse. If, as
I’d argue, a literary text like <em>Silence</em> could take the
supposition of such an alignment between desire and “Nature” for granted
several centuries later, though, the fact that it reintroduces the
question of sex comes uncomfortably close to undoing that work.</p>
<h2 id="sex-or-nature">Sex or nature</h2>
<p>While one of the most famous and ideologically significant moments in
the <em>Roman de Silence</em> is the allegorical confrontation between
Nature and Nurture, what’s at stake in this confrontation is not so much
the question of whether one or the other is ultimately determinate of
the protagonist’s sex as is whether Silence’s good nature will be
allowed to find expression despite their unconventional upbringing.<a
href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> Though the text does present a
situation in which there is a divergence between its subject’s “natural”
and socialized sex, the appeal it makes to the reader in terms of
recognizing which of these is Silence’s “right” sex is ultimately more
concerned with morality – with keeping in tact, that is, their “good
nature” – than it is with either etiological explanation or with
something like what we might today understand as “biological” sex. What
interests me here is on what terms Silence’s gender becomes a question
for the reader, particularly when speaking of a character in large part
defined by how they find themself at an impasse of what the text terms
“nature” and “nurture.”</p>
<p>At what point and how does “Nature” cease to be a merely metaphysical
category and come to be embodied in such a way that we might
unthinkingly recognize it as a more or less material reality? Upon
registering Nature’s “mourning and grieving” [<em>plaint et dolose</em>]
over the loss of the child to Nurture, the narrator recounts some of the
circumstances under which a person’s upbringing can override their
nature. The main claim of this narrative aside has to do with the
compulsion towards evil: negativity for Heldris has a gravitational pull
that goodness doesn’t, and questions of nature and <em>habitus</em> are
generally secondary to this more fundamental moral economy. “A little
bad nurture,” we’re told, “harms a good nature more / than lengthy
instruction in doing good / can mend a heart intrinsically evil.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn85"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></span> Likewise, when a person has
a “vile nature,” it <em>pays a deposit</em> on them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have seen many a man do the right thing<br />
for one, two, three or four years,<br />
only because of nurture,<br />
whatever his vile nature wants,<br />
and then afterwards repent of it,<br />
go back on his fine behavior;<br />
thus his wicked nature wins out<br />
by plunging him back into villainy.<br />
For his vile nature has paid a deposit on him [<em>Car li nature vils
l’enerre</em>],<br />
and his heart of coarse clay [<em>cuers de la grosse terre</em>]<br />
holds sway over him<br />
and soils his fine apparel.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might imagine the antinomies of “good” and “evil” and “nature” and
“nurture” as separate axes here, independent variables that come
together in the determination of a person’s character. To settle on
that, though, wouldn’t quite capture the text’s assumptions about agency
and free will, which I think when accounted for don’t allow us to read
these antinomies as is they were free-floating variables. While part of
what’s novel about <em>Silence</em> is the fact that it allows for a
figure like “Nurture” to appear as a character at all (let alone one
capable of overpowering “Nature”), the narrative’s supposition that
Nature, regardless of subsequent accidents of life and habit, “pays a
deposit” on the subjects may be a point that the introduction of a rival
“Nurture” ultimately functions to reinforce. In other words, we may well
ask whether there’s a sense in which the split between nature and
nurture functions to naturalize nature, to lend a sense of validity or
truthfulness to what’s natural over and against “nurture” or habit.</p>
<p>In Boethius we found proof of the existence of something like free
will in the observation that subjects are capable of abstention. In the
case of the “will to survival,” for instance, Boethius understands the
will to be operating contrary to nature when it refuses life – that is,
when it abstains from reproducing itself. Just as pertinent to his
theory of subjectivity, though, are those scenes in which acting in
accordance with nature requires a similar act of abstention. Such is the
position of the melancholic, for whom the <em>habitus</em> of sloth must
be overcome in order to act in accordance with their own nature and
“life-driven” desire. It’s in such a position that something like a
“death drive” comes into view as that aspect of subjectivity that
operates contrary to “nature.” What <em>Silence</em> introduces is
something that the moral philosophical form of the <em>Consolation</em>
can’t quite make room for, perhaps because of the way it exists
somewhere in between and in excess of the antimony between the “will to
survival” and the <em>jouissance</em> that accompanies the “love of
suffering”: that is, sexuality.</p>
<p>Silence’s assumption of a masculine role appears to be more than
simply a matter of performance or disguise. The narrative implies more
than once, for instance, that Silence takes on a number of presumably
“male” physiological traits: as a child, they “gr[ow] more sturdily in a
year / than others do in three,” and, as I briefly touched on before,
when they begin to enter adolescence they quickly prove themself to be
hardly lacking in matters of athleticism – “when they practiced
wrestling, / jousting or skirmishing, / he [Silence] alone made all his
peers tremble.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a
href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a></span> It’s at this point that
Nature is summoned by Silence’s own guilty conscience for “practicing
deception” [<em>fesist par couverture</em>], reprimanding Silence that
they’re wasting the “speciäl forme” that she had used to make them.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn88"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a></span> The definitive – “natural” –
criteria for their sex, though, don’t simply have to do with questions
of embodiment. Heldris notes wryly that “whatever one could see was
certainly male” but that “there’s more than meets the eye,” and Nature
taunts Silence by pointing out that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] there are a thousand women in this world<br />
who are madly in love with you<br />
because of the beauty they see in you –<br />
you don’t suppose they think something’s there [<em>Car puet scel estre
eles i croient</em>]<br />
that was never part of your equipment at all? [<em>Tel cose qu’en toi
nen a mie</em>]<br />
There are those who love you now<br />
who would hate you with all their hearts<br />
if they knew what you really are!<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that Nature makes her claim on Silence on the basis of
phallic criteria is itself, of course, a kind of ideological error. As
Geneviève Morel puts it, this error “consists in changing the status of
the phallus, from signifier of jouissance into master signifier of the
discourse on sex.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="morelAmbiguities"><a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a></span> That Nature’s
claim on Silence’s sex is illustrated with the taunt that any attraction
women might feel towards them is based on the mistaken assumption that
they have a penis illustrates the nature of this error quite lucidly. It
consists in the identification of the penis with the phallus, as both
the bearer of <em>jouissance</em> and the privileged signifier of sexual
difference as it pertains to either gender or biological sex. Silence’s
masculinity is ultimately thrown into doubt not because of how he is
embodied or interpellated but up to a certain point despite these
things, insofar, that is, as the “error” of their assigned sex assumes a
criterion of difference that consists in fetishizing a specific
organ.</p>
<p>As becomes clear soon enough, the result is that Silence can only
experience the sexual encounter itself as a threat, capable of
unravelling their being. This is why these phallic criteria underwrite
so much of how we’re told Silence comes to term with their own male
identification, even (or especially) in those moments where Silence
seems to come to this identification against the grain of those
criteria. Nature’s scolding instantiates a crisis of identification
rather than some sort of revelation about their true nature: when Nature
tells Silence to give up manhood and “go to a chamber and learn to sew!”
she triggers something of an identity crisis in Silence.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn91"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a></span> “I am other than who I was

data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a></span> Part of what makes this
scene so remarkable, though, is how this private dysphoric struggle gets
transformed into a neurotic psychomachia when Nurture shows up to make
the case for Silence’s manhood. Silence complains to Nurture that Nature
is probably right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did anything like this ever happen to anyone?<br />
Never! Now, when I get dressed,<br />
and don’t participate<br />
in the kinds of games that boys are used to,<br />
all my companions jeer,<br />
‘This one will be a terrible coward,<br />
if he lives that long!’<br />
But they don’t know how it is with me.<br />
Whenever I happen to get undressed,<br />
I am afraid my sex will be discovered.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nature’s intervention doesn’t appear to have needed to be argued: her
appeal doesn’t need to be made by way of an appeal to reason or
dialectic because what summons her is an already existing fear about an
already suspected truth. The prosopopoeic element of this scene stands
out in a tale that up to now hasn’t place a strong emphasis on allegory:
up to this point Nature is represented outside the actual world in which
Silence lives, as a device of the narrator. The appearance of Nature and
Nurture here, though, appears less as an <em>intervention</em> than as a
realization of an internal psychic conflict, enacting a sort of
prosopopoeic free indirect discourse whereby the terms of that conflict
can be projected outside of Silence’s inner world into the language of
allegorical dialogue.</p>
<p>Nurture does have a thing or two to say in response to this rather
impulsive decision of Silence’s to turn their life upside down and cease
living as a man, however. Nurture chases off Nature and summons Reason,
who makes the case that if Silence were to “abandon her nature / to take
up the habits of nature, / it would be almost as bad / as killing
herself,” not only because it’s how they’ve lived their whole life up
until this point but also because they would be giving up their
inheritance.<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn94"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a></span> It’s at this point, in an
oft-cited passage, that Silence reflects upon the implications of
continuing to live the rest of their life as a man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then he began to consider<br />
the pastimes of a woman’s chamber –<br />
which he had often heart about –<br />
and weighed in his heart of hearts<br />
all female customs against his current way of life,<br />
and saw, in short, that a man’s life<br />
was much better than that of a woman.<br />
“Indeed,” he said, “it would be too bad<br />
to step down when I’m on top.<br />
If I’m on top, why should I step down?<br />
Now I’m honored and valiant.<br />
No I’m not, upon my word – I’m a disgrace<br />
if I want to be one of the women.<br />
I was trying to make life easy for myself,<br />
but I have a mouth too hard for kisses,<br />
and arms too rough for embraces.<br />
One could easily make a fool of me [<em>On me poroit tost
afoler</em>]<br />
in any game played under the covers, [<em>Al giu c’on fait desos
gordine</em>]<br />
for I’m a young man, not a girl.<br />
I don’t want to lose my high position;<br />
I don’t want to exchange it for a lesser,<br />
and I don’t want to prove my father a liar.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Silence attempts to convince themself to hold onto their
masculine position and renounce “Nature.” The logic of this speech is
interestingly twofold: on the one hand, there is the relative privilege
granted to men under the patriarchal inheritance system that they would
be foolish to throw away. But it’s anxiety around the sex act itself
that occasions the thought, which I think Robert Clark is correct in
identifying as anxiety about the prospect of committing sodomy: “What
would he, a boy, have to do if he went underneath, if he wanted to be
‘like a woman’ (which is something different from being a woman) in the
game ‘under the covers?’”<span class="citation"
data-cites="clark2002"><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a></span> This sexual discomfort
disturbs the social logic of gender in this passage, as Silence’s shame
at the possibility of giving up a preferential social position for a
moment seems only to be a way of compromising with a deeper anxiety
about the otherness of feminine sexuality.</p>
<p>This discomfort is especially apparent in the fact that their
masculinity is accounted for not strictly through identification but by
way of negation: with their “<em>trop dure boche</em>” and “<em>trop
rois bras</em>,” their chiseled physique would hardly allow them to pull
off the “feminine” sexual role (so they imagine). The remark introduces
some ambiguity, though, in its elision of the role of the phallic
function: Silence’s claim to masculinity isn’t made on the grounds of
what he <em>has</em> so much as what he <em>doesn’t</em> have. We may
well ask <em>which</em> “game” Silence has in mind when they say that
they would be made a fool of in any game played “under the covers”
[<em>desos gordine</em>]: would this be any less the case if the sexual
partner were a woman? Part of what’s surprising about the passage is
that this latter question, at least for now, seems to be the wrong one –
the proof of his masculinity at this moment in the narrative isn’t to be
found in his sexual prowess but, in a sense, in his incompetence, in the
anticipation of something not quite working.</p>
<p>The passage articulates some of the ways in which heterosexual
masculinity is produced on the back of the foreclosure of certain forms
of enjoyment. As we’re told after this little soliloquy, one of
Silence’s defining virtues is his <em>abstinence</em>: “If what the
story that keeps alive / the memory of Silence tells us / is true, you
never heard of such forbearance [<em>abstinence</em>] / as was to be
found in Silence.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a
href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></span> As I touched on earlier,
this is on the one hand in sharp contrast with his father and king, but
scenes like this one also make clear how central sexuality is to how
gender functions within the text’s moral system. If one takes “Nurture”
to be on the side of something like gender, what I think can be seen
starting to take shape in this dysphoric scene is an attempt at
unstitching gender from <em>jouissance</em>, because what the narrative
is beginning to establish is an identification of living in accordance
with one’s “nature” with the capacity for taking part in the sexual act.
However, the distinction between gender and sexual enjoyment that the
text seems to be drawing here isn’t one that supposes that the
separating of the two is either ethical or desirable. What the
overpowering of nature by nurture in this scene implies is a trade off:
Silence can take on a position of phallic power – the athletic prowess,
the inheritance of his father’s lineage and wealth, his “high position”
– only by giving up sex altogether. In other words, within the demand
that Silence sacrifice their feminine sexuality without providing any
viable sublimation for it there is also be the quiet suggestion that
their eventual reconciliation with their “nature” is inevitable if only
because it is the only way for them to be a sexual subject.</p>
<p>The only moments in the narrative where Silence is actually
confronted with the possibility of having a sexual encounter are in the
series of seduction attempts by Queen Eufeme, who becomes a sort of
moral foil to Silence. Upon Silence’s return to his homeland after their
time abroad with the minstrels, Eufeme (not to be confused with
Silence’s mother, Eufemie) becomes obsessed with the youth after hearing
them play the harp after his triumphant return to court and Cador’s
re-legalization of minstrelry. Having had Silence come play the harp for
her in her chamber one evening, Eufeme offers Silence “two kisses for
one,” explaining that it’s a <em>riche cange</em>, a splendid deal or
“rate of exchange.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a
href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a></span> What becomes apparent in
this exchange is that the distinction between their two characters’
moral natures is not strictly reducible to questions of adultery and
loyalty but also bears on questions of enjoyment and moral economy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right on her forehead, just below her wimple,<br />
Silence gave her one chaste kiss –<br />
for you can be very sure he had no intention<br />
of kissing her the way she wanted.<br />
But the lady, who did not care<br />
to be kissed in this manner,<br />
gave him five long kisses,<br />
exceedingly passionate and very skillful.<br />
Besides the two kisses she had promised,<br />
she gave him so many others<br />
that he was extremely upset.<br />
The lady said, “My God! are you running away?<br />
What’s the matter?” she said, “is something wrong?<br />
Don’t you like the rate of exchange?” [<em>Ene vos plaist si fais
cangiers?</em>]<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a
href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s striking about this interaction isn’t so much that Eufeme
treats the kisses as if they were subject to laws of valuation as it is
that the laws by which she seems to think they operate aren’t
<em>just</em>. Her kisses are usurious kisses: what she describes as a
<em>riche cange</em> isn’t a kiss-for-kiss exchange but an unnatural
transformation of one chaste kiss into five lascivicious ones. This
disposition towards kissing for its own sake indicates a distinction
between Eufeme and Silence that may not be strictly sexual.</p>
<p>When Eufeme begins to take off her clothes and continue groping him,
Silence continues to be completely uninterested in her – “his nature
kept him from responding [<em>nel consent pas sa nature</em>].”<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn100"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a></span> In what sense does
Silence’s “nature” refuse to “consent” to Eufeme’s advances? The
function of euphemism here seems to be to insist upon a difference of
natures in such a way that begins to erode the pretext of sexual
difference. Silence’s “nature” doesn’t respond to Eufeme, both because
he lacks Eufeme’s insatiable desire for kissing but also because his
body apparently isn’t equipped to signify its own arousal in a
discursive situation that involves a naked woman pressing herself
against him. Ironically – not only given Silence’s earlier disgust at
the thought of bottoming but also the narrative’s suggestion here that
Silence is “really” a woman – Eufeme, upon once again failing to seduce
him later on, concludes that Silence is a “heretic” who must not be
interested in sleeping with women at all: “He likes young men a lot /
and really enjoys their company. / <em>Herites est</em>, I’d swear to
it, / and my love threatens him.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a></span> It’s striking, though, that
neither of these scenes provoke another moment of private reflection on
Silence’s part.</p>
<p>Rather than the dysphoric vertigo of that earlier scene of adolescent
self-doubt and its prosopopoeic conflict with an allegorically embodied,
capital-n “Nature,” what the narrative now runs up against is
<em>Silence’s</em> “nature.” Given the way the final scenes with Merlin
unfold, I would suggest that this move away from the prosopopoeial
register is intentional, cleverly foregrounding an eventual return of
“Nature.” What the narrative suggests, in other words, is that the
repression of “Nature” in the earlier dysphoric scene inevitably doesn’t
amount to her total exile but instead preserves her insofar as “nature”
is something that continues to be <em>felt</em> by its characters even
when only as a lack, as the “something” that’s felt to be missing in the
subject. I would argue that this is the central ideological conceit of
the tale, as it – startlingly – does seem to be offering the reader some
sense of an emergent account of “gender” that isn’t strictly reducible
to “nature” (let alone “biology”), but in the same motion that it marks
that distinction it also binds its terms together.</p>
<h2 id="merlins-laugh-and-feminist-critique">Merlin’s laugh and feminist

<p>It’s the bizarre final sequence of events, though, that brings back
“Nature” and “Nurture” one more time. In a final elaborate scheme to

<p>In an important piece, Sarah Roche-Mahdi has argued for the relevance
of the Arthurian canon in the final scenes of <em>Silence</em>, noting
that the consistency with which Merlin is characterized here with tales
like “Flualis” and “Grisandole” in the Arthurian <em>Vulgate</em> cycle.
“By the mid-thirteenth century,” she writes, ” his international persona
is fully formed: he is omniscient, a prophet, a king’s counselor, a
master shapeshifter; he has an urge to live as a Wild Man; he is given
to strange fits of laughter.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="rochemahdiReappraisal"><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a></span> While these
latter two characteristics are especially strongly attested in
<em>Silence</em>, it’s his “omniscience” and knack for disguise that
make him especially important to the plot of the text for Roche-Mahdi,
who argues that the two scenes in the text in which an old man appears
as a “friendly helper” – first, in Cador’s court as the first person to
notice that the minstrel “Malduit” is in fact Silence in disguise and
then again in the form of the man with the long white flowing hair and
the suspiciously finegrained instructions for how to capture Merlin.
These scenes speak, she argues, to Merlin as a “manipulator of the
action” of the narrative, whose “function is to reintegrate Silence into
her [sic] ‘natural’ social role as daughter, wife and mother.”<span

<p>Merlin certainly brings some revelations with him: upon arriving at
King Ebain’s court, he bursts out laughing at a nun in the queen’s
entourage, prompting Eufeme to complain to Silence for bringing a drunk
to the court. Merlin eventually explains that what’s provoked his
laughter the most is the ironic situation that all of them have been
fooled in one way or another by each other: “‘Two of us, I’ll have you
know, have tricked two of us / by wearing borrowed finery.’”<span

Silence had tricked him “by dressing like a young man.”<span

and married to the king.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the text prompts more questions than it answers. In
light of its abrupt and arguably unsatisfying ending, Roche-Mahdi
characterizes <em>Silence</em> as an “antiromance.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="rochemahdiReappraisal"><a href="#fn116"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a></span> The public revelation of
Eufeme’s ill intent is contrived and brutal, and Silence’s outing is
likewise abrupt and humorless: if the romance hero, according to Bloch,
is tasked with achieving “a balance between personal desire and social
necessity,” then, for Roche-Mahdi, the “substitution of <em>she</em> for
<em>he</em> makes such a resolution impossible.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="bloch1986 rochemahdiReappraisal"><a href="#fn117"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a></span> This seems to be in
reference to the deeply antifeminist undercurrent of the text, of which
Eufeme serves as the primary exemplar and whose comeuppance at the end
is very much consistent with this. It’s difficult at this point in the
text, for instance, to read Ebain’s speech about how “a woman’s role is
to keep silent” as mere irony when Eufeme gets frustrated at Merlin’s
refusal to explain himself to her for his laughter at the nun.<span
class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn118"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a></span> Despite having been, by
their own characterization, <em>mal duit</em> for having been raised as
a boy, much of Silence’s noblesse is established in contrast to the
deceitfulness and lust that is attributed to femininity so many times in
the text. Merlin’s own words in outing them to the king reflect this
ambiguity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silence is wise and valiant,<br />
good Sir King, so help me God,<br />
I don’t know any man, however strong,<br />
who could have conquered him in combat.<br />
A woman, tender little thing,<br />
knows she can dishonor you and does.<br />
And it was a woman who captured me.<br />
Is it any wonder I’m laughing,<br />
when they have deceived both of us like this,<br />
when they have set a snare for us<br />
such as twenty thousand men couldn’t?<br />
Sire, I think this is really funny.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text is keenly interested here in how Silence’s masculinity blurs
the line between deception and performativity, at once proving its
authenticity through Silence’s infatigable chivalry and undermining
those traits insofar as they mark a fundamental departure from Silence’s
own “true” feminine nature. This ambiguity seems to provoke, but also in
a sense escape, Merlin’s laughter, which is itself worthy of some
discussion.</p>
<p>Mladen Dolar has argued that “laughter is a condition of ideology”
insofar as it makes room for a kind of affective loosening-up or
“distance” that allows ideology to creep in under the “appearance of
spontaneity.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="dolaradorno zupancicComedy"><a href="#fn120"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a></span> Merlin’s laugh occurs at
the site of a malicious withholding of not jouissance but knowledge. It
functions as “a condition of ideology” insofar as it ascribes an
integrity to knowledge; it assumes that the Real is knowable (even if it
isn’t knowable at any given moment by <em>you</em>) rather than
fundamentally precarious. The laughter, then, also assigns a perverse
sovereignty to Merlin when this withholding of knowledge also amounts to
a willingness to let people suffer and die. Before realizing himself to
be in the presence of two crossdressers and a cuckold, Merlin laughs at
a content peasant who doesn’t anticipate his own imminent death, a leper
begging for alms not knowing that he is standing over a buried treasure,
and a corpse being buried in a churchyard.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a></span> What ought one make of the
proximity of this laughter to death, especially given that one of the
gender noncomforming characters he laughs at next is, too, sentenced to
death? The suggestion of the text is that despite Merlin’s cruelty and
gruff wildness that he possesses a kind of insight about reality that
others lack. This status isn’t fundamentally undermined by the fact that
he has apparently been “deceived” by Silence, as that deception itself
provides him with the hermeneutic fodder that up to this point nobody
else has had, that is, to “out” Silence as a woman disguised as a
man.</p>
<p>Heldris concludes the text with the admonition that “one should
praise a good woman / more than one should blame a bad one” because “a
woman has less motivation, / provided she even has the choice, / to be
good than to be bad.”<span class="citation" data-cites="Silence"><a
href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a></span> Despite this, Roche-Mahdi
writes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that Merlin subjects Silence to the prevailing cultural
norms of what is ‘natural’ for a female does not mean that the
<em>Silence</em> poet is an archconservative misogynist. Merlin is
simply being true to his character, as so well defined by Bloch:
guarding patriarchal values, reaffirming the power structure. I suggest
the author had a far from sanguine outlook on the possibilities the
female sex from traditional roles at upbringing.<span class="citation"
data-cites="rochemahdiReappraisal"><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Roche-Mahdi, the incoherence and abruptness of the
“antiromance’s” resolution suggests that the author to some extent
shares our disappointment in the structures refracted in his own text.
“In the real world, where men are on top, biology is destiny,” she
concludes, “the exceptional woman who crossdresses and outperforms men
is no solution. The idea that dares not speak its name is that society
must change.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="rochemahdiReappraisal"><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a></span> But whose
“real world” is being referred to here? Are Heldris’s misogynistic
asides and the violently normative thrust of his narrative to be merely
taken as ironic?</p>
<p>This readiness to align a feminist reading of the text with the
identification of the text as feminist reflects a tendency in medieval
feminist scholarship that I think is worth calling into question. There
may be something similar afoot in some recent attempts to bring
gender-bending texts such as <em>Silence</em> under the purview of a
“medieval transfeminism,” insofar as they assume a (white, bourgeois,
implicitly medicalist) model of transgender identity that assumes gender
to be something coherent, transparently knowable and thus worthy of
repairing and protecting. In a reading of Gower’s Narcissus in the
<em>Confessio Amantis</em>, for instance, M.W. Bychowski goes so far as
to invoke the <em>DSM-V’s</em> definition of gender dysphoria to
diagnose of Narcissus as a transgender woman.<a href="#fn125"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a>
In his reading of <em>Tristan de Nanteiul</em>, Blake Gutt asserts that
gender identification is “not a willful decision, with a ‘before’ and
‘after,’ but rather a deep and innate sense of who one (always already)
is.”<span class="citation" data-cites="gutt2018"><a href="#fn126"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a></span> What’s striking about these
readings isn’t so much the criteria that they assume for what counts as
a trans subject as the sense of universalism they lay claim to in doing
so: trans identification appears to only be legitimate so long as it can
be explained in terms of a diagnostic model or its ontological
certainty. What’s problematic about such accounts are less their utility
for giving voice to the self-understanding of this or that trans person
than their willingness to dispense with questions of difference –
questions which are of some importance if we want to be able account for
those scenes in which trans and queer desire might be <em>sustained</em>
by lack and historicity rather than only ever ontologically threatened
by them.</p>
<p>What these sorts of readings seem to symptomatize is a desire for a
kind of intimacy with these medieval texts that one should be cautious
not to simply dismiss though, since they, usefully, prompt the question
of how to account for the apparently foreclosed forms of life that these
texts seem to testify to. Roche-Mahdi begins to get at this in her
diagnosis of the centrality of Merlin to the plot of <em>Silence</em>;
accounting for this centrality undoubtedly lends to the sense that
Merlin’s laugh functions as a kind of death sentence insofar as it
expresses a willingness and ability to “let die” that is coextensive
with the possession and withholding of knowledge.<a href="#fn127"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a>
Chief among the deaths that laugh might be taken to accompany is
Silence’s. Though Cador’s decision to raise his child as a man was
always predicated on the assumption that Silence’s masculinity would be
revocable, the flipping of the switch, so to speak, is never something
that Silence is given the power to do themself, which makes their
feminization at the end of the story particularly grotesque. After
having already been stripped naked in front of the court in order for
the king to find “everything in its proper place,” Silence is dressed
again in women’s clothes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They dressed Silence as a woman.<br />
Lords, what more can I say?<br />
Once he was called Silentius:<br />
they removed the -us, added an -a<br />
and so he was called [<em>est només</em>] Silentia.<br />
After Nature<br />
had recovered her rights,<br />
she spend the next three days refinishing<br />
Silence’s entire body, removing every trace<br />
of anything that being a man had left there.<br />
She removed all traces of sunburn:<br />
rose and lily were once again<br />
joined in conjugal harmony on her face.<span class="citation"
data-cites="Silence"><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Silence’s, well, silence throughout this scene has been often
remarked upon – Sharon Kinoshita has objected, for instance, that the
marriage to Ebain is illegitimate on these grounds given thirteenth
century marriage laws requiring freely-given consent.<span
class="citation" data-cites="kinoshita2002"><a href="#fn129"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a></span> It seems notable to me,
though, that the text makes no remark upon this silence, especially
since it is often very ready to make puns on its titular character’s
name at other points in the narrative. While Silence’s lack of agency in
this scene certainly lends itself to the sense of irresolution or
anticlimax that accompanies this ending, I think there may also be some
wishful thinking in the implication that that lack of agency is simply
deployed as an ironic commentary or exposée of patriarchal social
structures or the romance genre itself. It may be unwise, in other
words, for a feminist reading practice to always count on the good faith
of the objects of its analysis.</p>
<p>While readings of <em>Silence</em> often make reference to Howard
Bloch’s discussion of the romance in terms of the tension between the
desires of the hero and society,<span class="citation"
data-cites="bloch1986"><a href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref130" role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a></span> one might
also recall Fredric Jameson’s emphasis on the “<em>worldness</em> of
romance” and the ways in which the romantic hero will often function as
a “registering apparatus for transformed states of being, sudden
alterations of temperature, […] in short, the whole semic range of
transformation scenes, whereby […] higher and lower worlds struggle to
overcome each other.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="jamesonPoliticalUnconscious"><a href="#fn131"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a></span> An intertextual account of
<em>Silence’s</em> place within the Arthurian canon or in light of other
thirteenth century romances may be insufficient in this light, and if
Silence functions as a “registering apparatus” of the various antimonies
of a larger generically delimited <em>narrative</em>, then criticism of
the text perhaps ought be able to account for the many ways in which
Silence’s “agency” and desire are never posited as Silence’s own in the
first place. In such a light our obligation as readers may not be to
repair that instrumentalization but to diagnose it in such a way that
might acknowledge and make room for other spaces of subjective
possibility.</p>
<p>Rather than attempting a decisive conclusion as to Silence’s gender
identity, then, the role of transfeminist critique may be to account for
the way Silence’s carrying out of this function as a “registering
apparatus” of the narrative’s various contradictions repeatedly poses
gender as a question. To do so may appear to run somewhat against the
grain of some of the presuppositions of a lot of recent transfeminist
scholarship, which is often understandably resistant to falling into a
kind of reading practice predicated on etiological explanations for
transgender subject formation, or in installing transgender subjectivity
as a kind of allegorical referent that can do the work of explaining
gender or sexual difference in a more universal sense. Emma Heaney’s
work is particularly revelatory in this respect, rigorously mapping the
ways in which a “modernist trans allegory” emerges in the work of
various modernist writers (including Freud) and post-war critical
theorists that instrumentalizes transgender subjects in deeply
dehumanizing ways.<span class="citation" data-cites="heaney2017"><a
href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a></span></p>
<p>My interest in Freud, though, comes less from a place of historicism
than from an investment in a long history of leftist and feminist
appropriations and extensions of the speculative kernel in his work.
Part of what I have in mind here is a distinction Jacqueline Rose once
offered between the “question” in the political sense – that is, of
<em>demand</em> – and the “question” in the psychoanalytic sense. This
latter sense of the “question” is less immediately concerned with
demanding, for instance, the conditions for liberation – that is, with
questions of recognition and identification – than it is with the
unconscious as the site of “an interminable self-questioning which
undermines any possible conclusion to self-definition.” “The argument,”
says Rose, “would be that feminism, in so far as it is in touch with the
sexual not just as an assertion, important though that is, but as a
self-questioning, can undo a certain rhetoric of certainty.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="roseWar"><a href="#fn133"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a></span> Once one accounts for this
instantiating impulse of psychoanalytic thought – to undermine, that is,
“rhetorics of certainty” – it becomes clearer that Freudian theory
begins from a set of observations about human sexuality that makes the
notion of something like a “cisgender” subject in a sense unthinkable.
From the perspective of transgender politics, such an orientation can
just as easily be a weakness as a strength, and has been
instrumentalized to as many utopian ends as phobic ones. This is, in
part, because a challenge that psychoanalysis has posed to other
theoretical idioms by understanding the signification of the phallus as
first and foremost based in an error or misrecognition has been to
prompt the question of how contingent or “universal” this signifying
system is itself.</p>
<p>On the one hand, one can argue that in the work of Freud or Lacan the
signifiers that describe the way sexual difference comes about aren’t in
themselves ever advertised as universal. On the other, for
psychoanalysis the fact that we come to a concept of otherness in the
sexual relation on the basis of such an error doesn’t necessarily mean
that error ought to be <em>corrected</em>, insofar as it enables desire.
Part of what locating this error helps us do, however, is to locate
something more insidiously ideological in the way people and bodies are
interpellated by the discourse on sex: that is, in the association of
the phallic function with a specific anatomical criterion or criteria
(whether that be according to the possession of certain organs or
chromosomes or some other ideal typical combination thereof). As Lacan
emphasizes in “The Signification of the Phallus,” there’s an important
sense in which the “phallus” as a signifier is never quite identical
with what it signifies or finds its form of appearance as – whether that
be in fantasy, an object, or in the organ with which it
“symbolizes.”<span class="citation" data-cites="lacanEcrits"><a
href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a></span> However, the fact that in
Lacan’s formulation the phallus “symbolizes” the penis or the clitoris
without being identical with it introduces some ambiguities.</p>
<p>For Geneviève Morel, who I cited earlier, this fraught relation
between the symbolic phallus and the real organ of the penis would
apparently seem to suggest that in a sense anatomy is destiny: the error
that grounds the neurotic subject’s desire consists, too, in this
anatomical misinterpretation. To reinterpret or reconfigure one’s
anatomy is, for her, often an act of “mutilation” that the trans subject
does to themselves in order to fruitlessly solve the unbearable aspects
of sexual difference.<span class="citation"
data-cites="morelAmbiguities"><a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a></span> In other
words, for her (and many other Lacanian analysts) “transsexualism” is at
bottom <em>psychotic</em> insofar as it represents an attempt to remove
oneself from the phallic function altogether, which requires, in
essence, talking oneself into misrecognizing the ways in which that
function is itself based in a misrecognition. Morel fails to account,
however, not only for the myriad ways in which transgender subjects’
identities are so often formed <em>against</em> the grain of the postwar
ego psychology of psychiatrists like Robert Stoller,<span
class="citation" data-cites="gill-petersonHistories"><a href="#fn136"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a></span> but also the ways in which
the modern discourse of “biological sex” today is not (has it ever
been?) simply an Aristotelian binary switch. Take, for instance, how
even this discourse’s most shrilly reactionary proponents, when
cornered, will cry wolf about gender being determined by not genitalia,
hormones, or performance but by “chromosomal sex.” If Morel’s
“transsexuals” psychotically try to sidestep the symbolic in such a way
that in fact insidiously enshrines it, then it can just as easily – and,
frankly, more relevantly – be observed that the transphobe’s myopic and
fetishistic devotion to the fantasy of a coherent account of “biological
sex” that is held together by a comparatively minor biological feature
at the expense of all other determinants also begins to resemble a
psychotic retreat from the Real.</p>
<p>It’s for this reason that I tend to agree with Shanna Carlson that
it’s more useful to describe the components of something like the
Oedipus complex as “singular statements, instead of as particular types
of identifying or identifiable persons.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="carlson2010"><a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a></span> What this
would point to is a way of capturing the dynamics of “intrasubjective
economy” that Lacan and Freud were able to discern by way of their
observations about the phallus without repeating the “error” in question
in such a way that fails or refuses to account for the fact that what
Lacanians refer to as a “mode of jouissance” isn’t a “mode” (e.g., of
production) or a “mentalité” as these concepts function in historicist
discourses but is rather something which must be <em>read</em> within a
context specific to the subject of an analysis. What I identify as
specifically “ideological” in <em>Le Roman de Silence</em>, then, is not
so much the erotic economy of difference that Silence finds themselves
in an uncertain position within, but more specifically the way “Nature”
begins to appear as a guarantor of desire that is bound inextricably to
the question of Silence’s “equipment.”</p>
<p>By “posing gender as a question,” then, my intention is simply to
keep that question an open one rather than to demand some framework for
etiological explanation or, heaven forbid, reproduce a “gender critical”
rhetoric through which I might imagine myself to be “just asking
questions” to the end of denying the legitimacy of someone’s claim to or
disavowal of a gender.</p>

data-cites="HomosexualDesire">Hocquenghem, <em>Homosexual
Desire</em></span>, 99, 100. For Hocquenghem “all homosexuality is
concerned with anal eroticism, whatever the differentiations and
perverse re-territorialisations to which the Oedipus complex
subsequently subjects it” (103). Though Hocquenghem is more steeped in
the language of Deleuze and Guattari than of Lacan, what concerns him
here is not only actual bodies but also their status in relation to the
Symbolic: “Our anal sexuality is enclosed somewhere between the sublime,
rarefied air of the mind and the deep excremental swamp of the anus”
(100). Hocquenghem’s reference to anality as a condition for property
ownership also recalls the ascetic dimension of capitalist accumulation
that Karl Marx describes in <em>Capital</em>. For Marx, an essential
characteristic of the capitalist is that from the perspective of the
market they must act as a personification of capital itself, which
requires that they must always be sacrificing their own enjoyment of the
product of capitalist circulation. This is what distinguishes capitalist
accumulation from hoarding. “For capitalism is already essentially
abolished once we assume that it is enjoyment that is the driving motive
and not enrichment itself” (<span class="citation"
