      <p>I renovated my webpage. Do you like it?</p>

      <p>It was kind of a pain in the ass. I wasn't very good at HTML when I
      first started this thing, and I was borrowing someone else's ugly CSS. So
      I got better at HTML and learned some CSS. I have a lot of long posts on
      here with some complicated footnote stuff going on so it took a while but
      I think it mostly looks nice now.</p>

      <p>I started this website so I could have a place to put writing scraps
      and irrelevant/stray thoughts while I was trying to finish my
      dissertation. I've decided to keep it around so I can hold myself
      accountable to keep writing. So I hope to post more on here soon.</p>
