    <h1>boethius with freud</h1>
      <p>For Freud the difficulty of melancholia lies in the way loss appears to
      be something of an enigma. Karl Abraham had ventured in 1911 to explain
      “neurotic depression” in terms of a subject’s resignation of
      gratification: “A neurotic will be attacked with anxiety when his instinct
      strives for a gratification which repression prevents him from attaining;
      depression sets in when he has to give up his sexual aim without having
      attained gratification.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="abrahamselected"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> By the time Freud
      turns to the subject in “Mourning and Melancholia,” though, he’s noticed a
      difference between those subjects whose symptoms could be attributed to a
      loss that was conscious – the grief over losing a loved one, or even for a
      time in which things were different – and those for whom it could not.
      Even in those cases where a conscious cause for grieving could be found,
      the significance of what had been lost wasn’t self-evident: “He knows
      <em>whom</em> he has lost but not <em>what</em> he has lost in him.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="SE14"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> The distinction
      ultimately hinges on identification: “in mourning it is the world which
      has become poor and empty; in melancholia it is the ego itself,” as the
      thing which has been lost – and around which strong feelings of both love
      and hatred have gathered – is unconsciously identified with.<span
      class="citation" data-cites="SE14"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>If this all sounds rather abstract it’s because melancholia doesn’t
      have one form or cause: the problem Freud begins from is the question of
      why there are those who demonstrate many of the same symptoms of someone
      who has experienced some great tragedy or loss but doesn’t themself know
      what the cause of those feelings may be. Depression may begin from
      grieving but it isn’t identical with it. It helps to describe when the
      perfectly “normal” response to some sort of loss becomes “pathological,”
      that is, when it persists beyond the reckoning with loss itself (“real” or
      otherwise) and may even become deadly. The melancholic ego is an open
      wound and a libidinal vacuum: it confronts us with the possibility that
      loss may not be all there is to loss. When my affective investment in my
      object – necessarily ambivalent – has nowhere to go upon losing (or losing
      interest in) that object, I turn that investment inwards. The question of
      loss now opens out onto questions of identification and the object itself:
      if there is a sense in which I “identify” with that object – that is,
      incorporate the elements of that object that elicited such strong feelings
      into my own ego – we may well wonder if that “object” is identical with
      the one that may have been lost or let go of in the first place.</p>
      <p>It’s because melancholia brushes up so closely to questions of desire,
      identification, and even pleasure that subjects (and narratives) often go
      to very great lengths to avoid it. What Freud called melancholia’s
      <em>ambivalence</em> – the way the melancholic internalizes their
      repressed scorn for the loved object – offers, I think, an illustrative
      case of what Lacan would later refer to as <em>jouissance</em>. In
      melancholia enjoyment appears not only as the “beyond” of pleasure – that
      is, the point at which physical stimulation risks tipping over from
      pleasure into displeasure (as in an orgasm) – but also reveals itself in
      the melancholic’s ambivalent attachment to their own symptoms and to the
      less dramatic ways a subject might take pleasure in their own displeasure.
      In both Abraham and Freud’s early observations about melancholia we find
      the observation that the patients derive a kind of perverse enjoyment of
      their own suffering.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I become habituated to my own despair;
      I attach myself to it. It’s the sense of what Lauren Berlant would perhaps
      refer to as <em>stuckness</em> that’s of interest here: the problem of
      melancholia comes into view alongside the observation that I may become
      attached to my own suffering in such a way that it begins to feel like
      home, so that to abandon it becomes unthinkable because it is, in a sense,
      unbearable.<span class="citation" data-cites="berlantSex"><a href="#fn5"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> Perhaps this is why melancholia
      is, in the middle ages, so strongly associated with <em>acedia</em>, with
      sloth generally being understood as not so much a sin against “work ethic”
      as of a certain perversion of desire, as a mismanagement of
      <em>jouissance</em>.</p>
      <p>In the medieval moral imaginary, concerns over money, anality, and
      sloth are ultimately economic: what’s at stake for so many texts that
      concern themselves with the ethics of these subjects is the question of
      how one ought to manage one’s own enjoyment, and the ways in which falling
      into and out of sin is less a question of epigenetic causality or a
      subject’s failure to conform with a specific model or type than it is a
      kind of libidinal balancing act. What these particular anxieties ask again
      and again is whether one’s enjoyment of an object that one doesn’t
      <em>sacrifice</em> and <em>dis-identify</em> with is really enjoyment at
      all. It’s the prickliness of this question that “Nature” is so often
      mobilized to smooth over, to provide an anchor point by which a subject
      might find its balance. In order to parse the antimony between “Nature”
      and “Nurture” (or <em>habitus</em>) in this imaginary, then, I think it’s
      important to account for how Nature is already a kind of supplement to the
      deeper state of ambivalence and uncertainty that marks the depressive
      position.</p>
      <p>While by the later middle ages sloth’s “innocent mixture of
      unwillingness and laziness” that we may at times be wont to understand as
      “a sin against the capitalist work ethic” is certainly something that we
      might trace coming into view in such expressions as the fourteenth century
      English preoccupation with <em>waste,</em> Giorgio Agamben reminds us that
      for the church fathers it named something far graver.<span
      class="citation" data-cites="agambenStanzas"><a href="#fn6"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span> If the affliction manifests
      itself as a “withdrawal from the divine good,” it is because this
      “<em>recessus</em> of the slothful does not betray an eclipse of desire
      but, rather, the becoming unobtainable of its object: <em>it is the
      perversion of a will that wants its object, but not the way that leads to
      it, and which simultaneously desires and bars the path to his or her own
      desire</em>.”<span class="citation" data-cites="agambenStanzas"><a
      href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span> When, for instance, Augustine
      recalls the ways in which his youthful love of the theatre was connected
      to a love of suffering – “I was allured all the more by the actor’s
      interpretation when it moved me to tears”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="augustineRuden"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span> – part of what’s
      sinful about this form of <em>jouissance</em> lies in its banality.
      Augustine’s appetite for suffering wasn’t for one that would “penetrate
      [him] deeply” but for a kind of suffering which would ultimately amount to
      an accretion of sickly little pleasures, “a seething, swelling
      putrefaction and revolting pus” of sinfulness.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="augustineRuden"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></span> What begins to come
      into view in such an account is the precariousness of the relation between
      enjoyment and desire: I take pleasure in suffering not because it’s
      suffering itself that I desire but because what that suffering occasions
      is my continued desiring. It’s here where sin enters the picture:
      ultimately, my desire is not, or not only, my own, and if that is the case
      than neither is the satisfaction which I withhold in my effort to continue
      desiring without end.</p>
      <p>The state Lady Philosophy finds Boethius in when she casts out the
      poetic muses in the beginning of the <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em> is
      not so dissimilar. These “chorus girls” (<em>scenicas meretriculas</em>),
      as they are described, substitute reason for the “useless thorns of
      passion” (<em>infructuosis affectuum spinis</em>), habituating the mind to
      illness rather than liberating it (<em>mentes assuefaciunt morbo, non
      liberunt</em>).<span class="citation" data-cites="boethiusLoeb"><a
      href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span> The narrator’s ailment is all
      the more grave for how comfortable he has become in occupying it.
      Melancholia is a <em>habitus</em> that extends beyond whatever may
      occasion it, a practice of suffering for its own sake, of digging one’s
      own heels into your grief. As the <em>Consolation</em> continually
      insists, however, such a state carries with it a “responsibility,” as
      Vance Smith puts it, for there “to be something that resolve[s] or
      transcend[s] it – that would terminate it.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="smithdying"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span> Answering such a demand is
      anything but straightforward. The cure for melancholia isn’t to be found
      in the mere rejection of suffering in order to aspire towards happiness
      and “good” pleasures. In fact, happiness – that is, fortuitous happiness,
      the kind that one generally pursues – can be in its own way cruel and
      capricious:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>[A]sk of a man who has been having a run of good luck whether he knows
      or doesn’t know that it can be taken away. If he doesn’t know, then he
      can’t be happy but only ignorant; and if he does know, then he can’t be
      happy because he is worried about losing everything at any moment, and
      this continual fear will keep him from being happy. Or there is a third
      possibility, which is that he thinks it won’t matter when he loses it all.
      But in that case, he doesn’t value it very much and doesn’t care about
      what he can so calmly imagine losing.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The problem with pursuing happiness in good fortune is that this sort
      of contingent, temporary satisfaction will always be predicated on a kind
      of cruel optimism insofar as it is predicated on whether or not one
      possesses it, and possession is always accompanied by the possibility for
      dispossession. A privileged case for this is money. “Are riches ever
      really yours?” Lady Philosophy asks, observing that “money is precious not
      when you have it but when it passes on from you to somebody else, in which
      case you don’t have it anymore.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></span> The paradox of
      wealth is that we only aim to accumulate it in order to spend it, we can
      only enjoy it by losing it.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t mean that a state of total dispossession is desirable or
      morally superior, though. The hypothetical existence of a “single man who
      had all the money in the world” so that “the rest of mankind would have to
      live without it” demonstrates that money “can’t be possessed without
      making others poorer.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span> The question of
      value is also a question of <em>enjoyment</em>: just as the melancholic
      goes against nature in refusing the satiation of their own suffering, the
      hoarder of wealth accumulates gold at the expense of their own enjoyment
      of it, and makes everyone around them impoverished in the process. In Lady
      Philosophy’s thought experiment, the existence of even one person who has
      abundant wealth while everyone else has none doesn’t amount to the
      abolition of money: rather than his money being worthless because it can’t
      be <em>exchanged</em>, the presence of wealth is always accompanied by its
      own lack. What should be noted in this account, though, is that this
      critique of wealth isn’t a critique of money itself: what’s importantly
      retained is a sense that there can be such a thing as a just exchange, and
      that the existence of money doesn’t in itself inevitably pave the way for
      the unequal accumulation of wealth. It’s possible, that is, to imagine a
      world in which we all lack equally.</p>
      <p>This dynamic is played out more fully in the dialogue on happiness. If
      worldly happiness doesn’t necessarily preclude suffering, it’s because
      people go to irrational, self-destructive lengths in order to pursue it:
      “we know that many men have looked for happiness even through pain and
      suffering. How, then, can this present life make them happy when the
      prospect of its end does not make them miserable?”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></span> If there’s
      something cruelly optimistic about happiness, then, it isn’t our desire
      for happiness itself that obstructs our own flourishing – the problem
      isn’t, in other words, that happiness is an <em>object</em> of our desire
      – but rather that we fetishistically mistake some <em>aspect</em> of
      happiness for Happiness qua Happiness. What Boethius grapples with in the
      first two books of the <em>Consolation</em> is the ethical impasse that
      accompanies just this realization. We may well ask if the mistake of the
      melancholic – the <em>morbus mens</em> – is, then, not only in mistaking
      fortuitous happiness for Happiness as such, but, moreover, because they
      <em>know better than to be happy.</em> In justifiably turning away from
      the false and momentary happiness of fortune, the melancholic also casts
      out God.</p>
      <p>The melancholic situation, then, always demands some sort of
      supplement. To the extent that it (like death) can’t ever be thought in
      terms of pure negativity or lack, it follows that the notion of a subject
      who <em>has no will</em> or who wills their own death is a kind of aporia,
      understandable only in terms of logical fallacy or (self-)deceit. That the
      depressive position registers an <em>impasse</em> wherein the subject is
      opportunely positioned to discern between the way their desire and their
      knowledge join hands to negate that subject is just what makes this
      impasse so productive for medieval writers. Melancholia has a
      <em>telos</em> in the sense that it produces the terms for its own
      dissolution, it demands a supplement by which its impasse can be
      traversed.</p>
      <p>Towards what, though? For Boethius, at least, the endpoint of
      consolation is perpetually deferred. As Mark Miller has pointed out, at
      the center of the <em>Consolation’s</em> dialectic is its collapse of two
      contradictory accounts of action, that is, between an essentially
      Aristotelian account according to which “everything an agent pursues is
      under the aspect of some good” and a stronger Platonist claim that “all
      action aims at one thing, which is ‘the good’ as such.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="miller2004"><a href="#fn16"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></span> It’s this failure to
      satisfactorily reconcile these two viewpoints, however, that makes the
      <em>Consolation</em> a compelling account of subjectivity, because it’s
      precisely in his attempt to conflate these two versions of agency in
      accounting for the human capacity for self-destruction that he introduces
      a split between will and desire.</p>
      <p>One of the more powerful moments where this split comes into view is in
      Book III, when upon demonstrating that “everything that exists endures
      [<em>manere</em>] and perseveres [<em>subsistere</em>] as long as it is a
      unity [<em>quam diu sit unum</em>] but is destroyed as soon as it ceases
      to be a unity” Lady Philosophy asks Boethius if, when acting “naturally,”
      if any living thing ever “abandons its appetite for existence and
      survival.”<span class="citation" data-cites="boethiusSlavitt
      boethiusLoeb"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></span> When Boethius denies this,
      with the possible exception of “plants or trees or things that are in no
      way alive,” Philosophy interjects that the same is true of them too, for
      “Nature gives each plant what is appropriate for it and keeps it alive for
      as long as possible.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></span> This “love of
      survival” unites both willing subjects and the natural world:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>“We are talking here not of voluntary motions of intelligent souls but
      of the workings of nature, in which we also participate. We digest the
      food we have consumed without any conscious thought and we breathe in our
      sleep without being aware of what we are doing. Even in living things,
      then, the love of survival [<em>manendi amor</em>] is not something that
      is willed but a consequence of natural principles. Indeed, there are times
      when the will may decide it is better to die, while nature fears and
      avoids death. Or although nature always wants it, there may be occasions
      when the will decides to refrain from the act of procreation that
      perpetuates all mortal things. You see, then, that this love of self comes
      not from the will but from nature, as a gift of providence, so that all
      things desire to persist and endure for as long as they can.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a href="#fn19"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The existence of free will introduces the possibility that the subject
      may act against their own desire, which, she explains, is always a desire
      for “unity” [<em>Omnia … unum desiderant</em>], which is not only “the
      same thing as the good,” but also both the “end and the object of all
      things.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> The culmination of this argument is
      found in the next book – when Lady Philosophy explains that since everyone
      desires the Good whether they realize it or not, “the wicked are actually
      happier being punished than they would be if there were no retribution to
      restrain them.”<span class="citation" data-cites="boethiusSlavitt"><a
      href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>This split between will and desire is necessary for the
      <em>Consolation’s</em> dialectic to establish God as both the
      <em>telos</em> and <em>object</em> of all desire. That is, in order to
      maintain that the subject falls under the swing of an the ontologically
      primary “life drive” – that is, of an erotic “desire to be one” that
      inheres to the “love of survival” – it is necessary to ontologically
      abolish from “nature” and from <em>desire</em> any suggestion of a
      division within desire itself. The subject can <em>will</em> their own
      death, but in doing so they are acting contrary to their own desire and,
      it follows, against nature and the good: “Nam saepe mortem cogentibus
      causis quam natura reformidat voluntas amplectitur” (the will
      [<em>voluntas</em>] often, with good cause [<em>cogentibus causis</em>],
      embraces death while nature recoils from it).<span class="citation"
      data-cites="boethiusLoeb"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>The split between <em>desiderium</em> and <em>voluntas</em> on the one
      hand preserves the rationality of both terms. For even when the will
      embraces death, it doesn’t do so without <em>cogentibus causis</em>, that
      is, without compelling grounds or cause for doing so. But why should this
      account of the will emerge first from an observation about procreation?
      What’s striking in this account is the will’s negativity: it appears here
      in the act of <em>refraining</em> from procreation, “the act that
      perpetuates all mortal things.” Given the <em>Consolation’s</em> lack of
      concern with the more overtly theological entanglements of things like
      carnal desire and sinfulness, it’s notable that here there should be some
      urgency in establishing its account of the will by introducing a point of
      divergence from it and a deeper, more authentic, desire that is
      coterminous with the natural imperative to reproduce. This would appear to
      be an interesting contrast to a thinker like Augustine, for whom the
      division between carnal and spiritual desire is a point of productive
      contradiction, because sexuality itself is the punishment for sin – “God
      had blessed them with the words, Increase and multiply and fill the earth
      (Gn 1:28), but it was by sinning that their bodies incurred mortality, and
      sexual union is possible only for mortal bodies.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="augustineMarriage"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span> As Alenka
      Zupančič has argued, this notion – that prior to the Fall there were
      possibilities for reproduction that wouldn’t involve sexual union – can be
      seen as part of a larger ideological project of Christianity to “separate
      sexuality from enjoyment,” insofar as sin inscribes a lack in nature. If
      we are <em>naturally</em> compelled to reproduce, then, the thing that
      makes the actual carrying out of this imperative unbearable lies in nature
      itself: sex reminds us that “nature lacks something in order to be Nature
      (our Other) in the first place.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="zupancicSex"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></span> The symptom of this
      predicament is the shame that accompanies knowledge: the awareness of
      one’s own nakedness, of the necessity of the sexual act in order to
      fulfill this procreative imperative is itself a reminder of a loss:
      “‘knowing the other in the biblical sense’ is to engage with the point in
      the Other where knowledge is lacking.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="zupancicSex"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>For Boethius, though, the division between will and desire speaks to
      the myriad ways the subject is prone to misrecognizing or misreading their
      own desire. The result is that this constituent negativity is less
      characteristic of knowledge than it is of the will. Perhaps this is why
      Lady Philosophy only addresses the issue of reproduction by way of a
      digression on plants – to address human reproduction would mean locating
      negativity within knowledge itself rather than within the will. This may
      be where the ideological kernel of the <em>Consolation</em> begins to come
      into view: not, perhaps, so much in the explicit unstitching of sexuality
      from <em>jouissance</em> as in the unconscious need to preserve the
      wholeness of “Nature” as a bedrock of certainty against which I might
      discern the truth of my desires. Such an account remains coherent only so
      far as sexuality and enjoyment remain outside of the picture, but it’s in
      such moments as this one when their absence is most felt. Insofar as the
      <em>Consolation</em> is a text about discerning one’s desires, perhaps it
      is this elision that allows the text’s dialectic to take on its curative
      function when it introduces its melancholic supplement in the form of
      discourse.</p>

      which have been turned round upon the subject’s own self in the ways we

      editions of the <em>Consolation</em>, I refer to Slavitt’s English
      translation and the Loeb edition’s Latin as supplement. The original Latin
      for this latter passage is a little less concise than how Slavitt renders
      it, though my reading here agrees with his interpretation. Lady
      Philosophy’s original wording might be more literally rendered as “all
      things end [in the highest good] and it is that [i.e., the highest good]
      which all things desire”[<em>‘Quis esset,’ inquit</em> – referring back,
      that is, to Boethius’ earlier acknowledgment that all things tend towards
      the “summum bonum” a little earlier on lines 115-116 – <em>rerum omnium
      finis. Is est enim profecto, quod desideratur ab omnibus</em>].<a
