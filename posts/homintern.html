    <h1><em>homintern</em> post mortem</h1>
    <p>I was initially recruited for <a href="https://homintern.soy/"
    target=_null><em>Homintern</em></a> to be one of the
    magazine’s agony aunts. Marguerite had the rather ambitious idea for a
    kind of psychoanalytic advice column. It would have two “aunts” – myself
    and Mike Crumplar – each giving different perspectives on various
    suffering readers’ problems. Marguerite is the type to collect different
    characters and put them together to see how they counteract each other.
    This, I suppose, was one of her little experiments. She also wanted to
    give us little prompts to respond to various weird internet cultural
    relics. “Mpreg” manga and the like.</p>
    <p>Enid Witkiowski was to be a sort of trashy drag persona of sorts – I
    think I was in a sort of nameless they/them stretch of my twisted road
    to transitioning at the time and I didn’t want to use my given name. I
    threw around some aunt-like names with my friend we landed on Enid.
    “Witkiowski” was Marguerite’s misspelling of “Witkowski,” a name I chose
    after reading an essay by the art historian Michael Camille
    (“Dr. Witkowski’s Anus: French Doctors, German Homosexuals and the
    Obscene in Medieval Church Art”). G.J.A. Witkowski was a gynaecologist
    and an amateur art historian at the turn of the century who wrote a book
    on obscene medieval church art. His motivation for writing about this
    topic was a desire to both “expose the hypocrisy” of the Church and also
    indulge in some rather crude medical history. I liked the way Camille
    characterized Dr. Witkowski’s understanding of history: as “a vast stone
    clinic where he was able to diagnose a thousand years of bodily function
    and dysfunction in the forms of overblown phalluses, trumpeting anuses
    and squirting breasts.” “He’s just like me!” I thought.</p>
    <p>Mike’s attention drifted off to other projects and Marguerite had
    enough on her plate as EIC so I wound up just doing the advice column
    solo as Aunt Enid. We only ended up publishing two columns but I
    remember having one or two others on my old computer that we never got
    around to publishing before <em>Homintern</em> crumbled apart. Whatever.
    I enjoyed writing the column, though it was a bit stressful at times. I
    mean, really, who am I to give anyone advice? And some of the ways
    people described their problems were really much too vague and hand-wavy
    for me to have anything useful to say in response anyway. I wound up
    writing these verbose riffs on gender and depression that seem pretty
    silly to me now, but that’s okay. I still agree with most of it, though
    I cringe when I read myself advising some people to go to therapy. At
    the time I was in psychotherapy myself and I suppose I was still
    convinced there might be something to it.</p>
    <p>I’d do it again, I suppose, though I don’t really like advice
    columns. I think giving people advice is pretty presumptuous. I still
    hand it out sometimes though. We all have a little fascist in us. I
    think the purpose of an advice column should be to offer as little
    advice as possible, and I suppose I’d say I was more or less successful
    by that measure.</p>
    <p>I wasn’t officially part of the <em>Homintern</em> editorial board
    until after the iconic first “issue” had already come out and I don’t
    feel like my contributions to the magazine were on the whole
    particularly constructive. I wrote the advice column, pestered some
    people to submit things and made it clear when I thought a submission’s
    reading of Marx was unforgivable. I guess this made me an honorary
    “editor,” but I was really just the magazine’s weird aunt. There were a
    couple pieces I gave feedback on that the writers subsequently gave up
    on and there were some others that simply ended up in editorial
    purgatory in the chaotic early months of the pandemic. One of the pieces
    that didn’t make it through that period was by my friend Juliana
    Gleeson, which I think she’s since published elsewhere. To be honest, I’d
    been assuming we were dead in the
    water for a while before it was officially announced. It was also 2020.
    I was busy teaching, going to protests, getting tear gassed and bruised
    up by the pigs, and working on my doctoral dissertation.</p>
    <p>Other than that, I spent most of my time as an editor rejecting
    things. I think I probably gave more “reject” votes than any of the
    other editors. Sorry. I remember wanting to read more Marxist
    submissions that weren’t just written by undergraduate humanities majors
    who had never read <em>Capital</em>. It also hadn’t occurred to me that
    we would end up publishing so much poetry. I was a bit of a bitch about
    it. I think I convinced all the other editors that I simply hated
    poetry, despite the fact that my academic training more or less revolved
    around it. It was mostly a bit. Saskia and Jesi were able to get some
    really incredible stuff out there, a good amount of which Saskia was
    translating herself. I’m still so impressed by that.</p>
    <p>I remember when I attended the <em>Historical Materialism</em>
    conference in London in 2019, everyone in the queer feminist corner I
    was lurking around in was talking about all the “gay communist”
    magazines that were popping up at the time. <em>Homintern</em> felt
    rather out of place among these. Part of its charm was that it wasn’t
    really part of that scene. It wasn’t academic. It didn’t affect any
    revolutionary ambitions. None of us had published in magazines like
    <em>Endnotes</em> or <em>Salvage</em>, and our opening editorial
    statement joked about suicide bombing the Verso loft. It wasn’t a “good
    magazine.” It wasn’t even particularly invested in being either “gay” or
    “communist.” It was just <em>Homintern</em>; it had a kind of ineffable
    swag. I’m pleased to have played a modest role in it.</p>
