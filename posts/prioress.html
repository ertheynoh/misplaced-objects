    <h1>the child's voice in the prioress's tale</h1>
      <p>(new chaucer society biennial congress, 13.6.23)</p>

      <p>At the heart of the <em>Prioress’s Tale</em> is a dead child. As a text
      which explicitly situates itself within what critics Hannah Johnson and
      Heather Blurton have described as a “network” of antisemitic blood libel
      narratives, central to the way it reproduces Christian antisemitic
      ideology is by way of its instrumentalization and objectification of the
      child. One tradition of scholarship has emphasized the ways in which the
      the tale is characterized by its own <em>inability to mourn</em>: while
      the text’s “lost object” is apparently the child himself, the false
      attribution of responsibility for that death onto a racist caricature of a
      population of Jews speaks to a resistance to the acknowledgment of
      Christian society’s aggression towards its own children. As Aranye
      Fradenburg chillingly put it in her classic essay, “Criticism,
      Antisemitism and the Prioress’s Tale”, once we recognize the fictional and
      propagandistic nature of the attribution of child murder to the Jews in
      medieval blood libel narratives, “if the Jews were not responsible for
      those dead Christian children, who was?”<span class="citation"

      <p>Part of what readings like those of Fradenburg or Bruce Holsinger bring
      into view is not only the centrality of anti-Jewish violence to the
      <em>Prioress’s Tale</em> but also the intimacy of this violence with the
      dark side of reproductive futurism. The function of Marian theology in the
      tale and others like it is to paranoiacally project responsibility for the
      violence Christian culture inflicts on its own children to an Other. What
      such propaganda brings into view with special clarity is that if within
      such a culture, as Lee Edelman famously put it, “the sacralization of the
      Child necessitates the sacrifice of the queer,”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="nofuture"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> or, for that matter the Jew,
      <em>then it also requires the sacrifice of the child</em> to the same
      symbolic order which sacralizes it. In the <em>Prioress’s Tale</em>, this
      sacrifice happens in large part on behalf of <em>the voice</em>.</p>
      <p>Often, the “voice” is taken to be something that is more or less
      self-present and autonomous. The voice might be silenced or restored, or,
      sometimes, it needs to be “listened to,” allowed to speak for itself.
      Fradenburg, for instance, calls out Chaucerian scholarship for its role in
      “the unmaking of the voice of the Jew,” in a trend that Blurton and
      Johnson traced in detail in their book the <em>Critics and the
      Prioress</em>, in which critics acknowledge the antisemitism of the text
      but nevertheless seem to find something redemptive in its affective piety
      and aesthetic achievement.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="blurton2017"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span> One may recall, too, Eve
      Salisbury’s recent work in <em>Chaucer and the Child</em>, which attends
      to what Salisbury identifies as “Child Chaucer”, that is, “the component
      of mind that enables the poet to breathe life into his characters, speak
      in the voice of the child, and lure readers into his virtual worlds.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="salisburyChild"><a href="#fn4"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> Part of what’s discomfiting in
      the <em>Prioress’s Tale</em>, though, is precisely the way the “voice” of
      the child is preserved or achieves wholeness by way of its being
      <em>severed</em> from the subject it constitutes. In a sense, the child is
      sacrificed to its own voice.</p>
      <p>As the prioress insists in the prayer to the Virgin that serves as the
      basis of her prologue, the praise of God can be “performed” even by the
      youngest of children. The lines here are somewhat ambiguous: “by the mouth
      of children thy bountee / Parfourned is, for on the brest soukynge /
      Somtyme shewen they thyn heriynge” (455-59). “On the breast sucking” may
      be invoked, of course, simply to connote a stage in a subject’s life in
      which sucking is mutually exclusive to speaking. But the semantics of the
      prioress’s wording also suggests that the act of sucking is itself a
      performance of praise, perhaps even an attempt at interpretation. Before
      she begins the tale, the prioress identifies her own voice with that of
      the pre-linguistic infant:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>My konnyng is so wayk, O blisful Queene,<br />
      For to declare thy grete worthynesse<br />
      That I ne may the weighte nat susteene;<br />
      But as a child of twelf month oold, or lesse,<br />
      Right so fare I, and therfore I yow preye,<br />
      Gydeth my song that I shal of yow seye (481-87).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Already, a concept of childhood is being put to work by way of a theory
      of the voice: the pre-linguistic infant speaks to the prying apart of
      praise from linguistic signification. “Praise,” here, doesn’t refer to any
      particular speech act or performance, but is itself an <em>object</em>.
      This object, like Walter Benjamin’s puppet of historical materialism who
      “enlist[s] the services of the one who is operating it, who is literally
      pulling its strings,” speaks to the way in which praise precedes the
      subject who utters it, such that the latter appears as an aftereffect of
      the former.<span class="citation" data-cites="benjaminilluminations"><a
      href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> For Mladen Dolar, Benjamin’s
      parable speaks to the way in which “the thinking machine was but an
      extension of the speaking machine,” revealing the secret of thought
      itself, in a sense, to be “thoughtless.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="dolarvoice"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>Such is the role of the “voice object” as Dolar theorizes it in <em>A
      Voice and Nothing More</em>. The voice, rather than being a source or
      vehicle of meaning, is instead its <em>ocassion</em>. Dolar begins, with
      Jacques Lacan, with the example of the infant’s scream:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The first scream [he writes] may be caused by pain, by the need for
      food, by frustration and anxiety, but the moment the other hears it, the
      moment it assumes the place of the addressee, the moment the other is
      provoked and interpellated by it, the moment it responds to it, <em>scream
      retroactively turns into appeal</em>, it is interpreted, endowed with
      meaning, it is transformed into a speech addressed to the other, it
      assumes the first function of speech: to address the other and elicit an
      answer.<span class="citation" data-cites="dolarvoice"><a href="#fn7"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The voice demonstrates the way in which “the presymbolic acquires its
      value only through opposition to the symbolic, and is thus itself laden
      with signification precisely by virtue of being non-signifying.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="dolarvoice"><a href="#fn8"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span> This comes into view in the
      dialectical relationship described by Lacan between <em>demand</em> and
      <em>desire</em>: desire only comes into view as the surplus of demand over
      need, coming to occupy the space between particular demands and their
      apparent fulfillment. As Lacan puts it, for the infant, a demand is a
      “demand for a presence or an absence;” it reveals the way in which the
      Other is “situated <em>some way short of</em> any needs which it might
      gratify.” But it’s precisely in this falling short that the demand’s
      particularity takes on meaning: for the child, the presence of the mother
      becomes itself a “proof of love,” and for the (m)other the scream is
      received as a demand, it elicits a response. The “voice itself, the
      scream,” Dolar writes, “is already an attempt at interpretation,”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="dolarvoice"><a href="#fn9"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></span> initiating an encounter whose
      subsequent unfolding provides its impetus.</p>
      <p>In other words, the “voice object” speaks to the non-identity between
      language and its vehicle, and there is an important sense in which the
      meaningless objecthood of the sound of the voice itself speaks both to the
      limits of our ability to achieve unmediated communication with the other
      and the ways in which it paradoxically <em>enables</em> us to have
      meaningful exchanges in the first place. My scream doesn’t take on meaning
      until it is answered: my discomfort gets transformed into a demand not by
      me but by the one who grants their presence in response to that scream.
      Rather than itself testifying to the presence of a self-knowing and
      self-contained subject, the voice speaks to a <em>rupture</em> in the
      subject, who is never fully “present” on its own as a self-contained
      “being” but is always anticipating, always being pulled along the chain of
      signification. “We are in the world,” as Leo Bersani once described, “as
      the psychic droppings that will be identified as” what Lacan called the
      “little object,” continually <em>occassioned</em> by those those objects
      as they come stammeringly into being along the procession of
      discourse.<span class="citation" data-cites="bersanirectum"><a
      href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>The little clergeon’s habits precede him: every day he walks to school
      he passes an image of Mary, and whenever he passes an image of Mary he
      kneels and says his <em>Ave Maria</em> and goes on his way. Eventually, in
      school, the child begins to learn <em>Alma redemptoris mater</em> from his
      primer, studying it until he’s memorized the first verse. Not knowing what
      the Latin words mean, he asks an older schoolmate to explain what the song
      is about. The other student tells him that the song is a prayer to the
      Virgin but he too, doesn’t understand Latin: “‘I lerne song; I kan but
      smal grammeere’” (534-36). Having been taught to show particular reverence
      for the Virgin by his single mother, the mere mention of Mary is
      sufficient to goad the child into determining to learn the rest of the
      song.</p>
      <p>At the center of this setup is the emphasis on routine, repetition, and
      ritual; the little clergeon is passionate about having a <em>habitus</em>,
      and takes to singing the song twice a day, every day, on his way back and
      forth from school. The poem takes a certain pleasure in repetition in the
      first part of this little <em>vita</em> in miniature: there’s the
      repetition of “little” – the “litel scole,” the “litel child” with his
      “litel book lernynge” – as well as the emphasis on habit and doing things
      by rote – the memorization of songs, the routine of walking through the
      Jewish ghetto every day to go to school.</p>
      <p>In his essay “Pedagogy, Violence and the Subject of Music,” Bruce
      Holsinger in particular has called attention to how the child’s
      <em>repetition</em> of the hymn puts him at odds with the disciplinary
      regime of the school, as many music educators in the fourteenth century
      were discouraging learning song through rote memorization as opposed to
      the more disciplined musical study of solmization. The boy vows to
      memorize the song by Christmas, though, even at risk of being “beaten
      thrice in an hour” by his schoolmaster, in order to honor the Virgin:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>His felawe taughte hym homward priveley<br />
      Fro day to day, til he koude it by rote<br />
      And thanne he song it wel and boldely,<br />
      Fro word to word, acordynge with the note.<br />
      Twies a day it passed thurgh his throte,<br />
      To scoleward and homward whan he wente;<br />
      On Cristes mooder set was his entente (544-50).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The word “throte” appears four times in the short tale; only in the
      stanza above is it used as an end word, rhyming, here, with “rote” and
      “note,” and, ironically, the song quite literally becoming stuck in the
      child’s throat. The Jews, apparently sick of hearing the child skipping
      through their neighborhood singing a hymn to the Virgin Mary, are goaded
      by “the serpent Satan” to kill the little clergeon, cutting his throat and
      throwing him in a latrine.</p>
      <p>Eglentyne’s warning to the Jews characterizes the crime in terms of its
      impossibility of being <em>contained</em>: “Mordre wol out, certeyn, it
      wol not
      faille, / And namely ther th’onour of God shal sprede; / The blood out
      crieth on
      your cursed dede” (574, 576-8). When the child doesn’t return home, his
      mother searches tirelessly for him, going door to door and asking every
      Jew in the quarter if they’ve seen him:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>They said seyde “nay”; but Jhesu of his grace<br />
      Yaf in hir thoght inwith a litel space<br />
      That in that place after hir sone she cryde,<br />
      Where he was casten in a pit bisyde (603-6).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>There’s a striking temporal compression that seems to occur in these
      lines: Jesus whispers in the mother’s ear, we suppose, where her child’s
      corpse lies; this happens upon her exhausting the ghetto of Jews to
      implore and, presumably, walking past the latrine in which he’s been
      disposed. Curiously, line 605 (“That in that place after her son she
      cried”) – the referent of the inaugural “that,” which is presumably the
      revelation of the child’s location – is elided: Christ puts –
      <em>something</em> – in the mother’s thought within a “little space” which
      coincides exactly with her coming within physical proximity to the latrine
      in which her child’s corpse has been disposed. It’s at this point that she
      emits a cry and the cry is answered, as the child’s corpse sits upright
      and bursts into song despite its presumably severed vocal chords.</p>
      <p>One thing that distinguishes the representation of the child’s death
      from some of Chaucer’s other death writing such as in the <em>Book of the
      Duchess</em> and the <em>Pardoner’s Tale</em> is that rather than being
      stolen from view by the scaffolding of the fiction, here it’s dramatically
      staged, ritualized and <em>witnessed</em>, as the local Christians gather
      around the scene and carry the singing corpse to the nearest abbey. When
      the abbot sprinkles holy water on the child, he recounts a vision of the
      Virgin placing a “grain” on his tongue, instructing him to continue
      singing until it is removed. Having been “translated” to a proper burial
      site, the abbot gently removes the grain from his tongue, allowing his
      soul to ascend. What Heather Blurton and Hannah Johnson have called “the
      ritual production of the miracle” is at least as central to the narrative
      as the murder itself, and both elements – miracle and murder – are
      inextricably linked by a body that refuses to remain hidden.</p>
      <p>There’s an insistently circular logic at play here: the hymn serves as
      both the cause of the child’s death and means of his discovery,
      instantiating one form of sacrifice and retroactively transforming it into
      another. The metaphor of crying blood that can’t be contained, too, poses
      a notable contrast with the Prioress’s own portrait in the <em>General
      Prologue</em>, in which her prim table manners suggest an aversion to
      spilling and waste. It’s in this respect that the Prioress’s
      characterization may have as much of the maternal as the childish.
      Readings of the poem have often emphasized its relationship to a
      liturgical culture in which adults were often explicitly encouraged to
      identify as children in their subordination to religious authority,<span
      class="citation" data-cites="salisburyChild pattersonwitnesses"><a
      href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span> but within the text, too, is
      an economy of circulating blood and milk and “grains.” The insistent
      return of the body, of the blood that won’t be silenced, excludes the Jews
      from this insular economy by suggesting their inability to contain – or
      properly consume – its circulating objects.</p>
      <p>As Salisbury points out, in the burial of the clergion it’s the
      “affective puissance of the child” that comes to the fore: “the child
      makes the action happen, [she writes] moves the adults to pay attention to
      the child’s needs and remember what it was like to be a child. When one of
      the precepts of this culture is for adults to become <em>like</em>
      children, it signals the value of childhood by exposing the sacrificial
      economy in which a child lives” (106). This sacrificial economy is vividly
      illustrated with the initial call and response between mother and child.
      Here, it isn’t the child who emits the initial demanding cry, but the
      mother, and it’s the child’s voice which returns the proof of love in the
      form of the hymn to the Mother.</p>
      <p>Part of what’s so remarkable about this scene is that the tautological
      economy in which God performs his own praise “by mouth of innocentz”
      sutures an alien voice-object to the body of the child. In psychoanalytic
      terms, the child functions here as the substitute for the mother’s
      <em>objet a</em> or symptom, a situation in which the child serves the
      function of subordinating their own particularity to the embodiment of the
      what the mother finds lacking in the father and, in the process, as Lacan
      puts it, “alienates in himself all possible access by the mother to her
      own truth through giving it body […].”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="lacanChild"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></span> Lacan’s account of the
      child-as-object recalls Sándor Ferenczi’s reflection on the “dream of the
      wise baby” described to him by one patient in his 1932 essay on the
      “Confusion of Tongues between the Adults and the Child”, in which the
      child, perversely, survives an abusive relation with the parents by
      <em>identifying</em> herself with them, and, in a sense, becomes their
      psychiatrist. The child, here, is objectified insofar as she is made to be
      a symptom of the abusive structure of the family itself.</p>
      <p>What I’d like to suggest here is that our perspective on the function
      and agency of the child may begin to look quite different when we shift
      our perspective back from the altar to the shitter. Part of what this
      entails may involve insisting on a distinction between the child’s agency
      and the voice-object which occasions his sacrifice.</p>
