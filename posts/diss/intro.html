    <h1>introduction</h1>
      <p>There’s something repulsive about being mentally unwell. When
      fifteenth century poet Thomas Hoccleve shares his narrative of his own
      struggle with mental illness with a trusted friend in his
      <em>Dialoge</em> – the second framing poem of the collection of poems
      that we now call the <em>Series</em> – the latter’s first response is to
      insist that Thomas show no one else: “Reherse thou it not ne it awake. /
      Kepe al that cloos for thin honours sake.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> The friend’s
      response to reading Thomas’s complaint about his descent into a kind of
      depressive psychosis and the social alienation he’s experienced as a
      result of it reminds us, though, that his mental illness is a
      <em>social</em> pathology. Thomas’s health risks falling back into the
      realm of the pathological when he’s perceived as having never parted
      from it in the first place. His sanity is contingent on his ability to
      “pass” as sane. For Hoccleve the symptom is less importantly an
      indicator of health than a reminder that his “health” is something
      determined and diagnosed by everyone but the one who bears it.
      Hocclevean irony being such that the poem is its own symptom, the
      <em>Series</em> never ultimately describes the illness in question
      except through second or third hand accounts, leaving us with a narrator
      who can only complain about how he’s being talked about.</p>
      <p>The present dissertation begins from an interest in such positions of
      lessened or foreclosed agency, in which a kind of subject position is
      occasioned by its own lack of information or authority with respect to
      its form or destiny. It begins, and will end, with Thomas Hoccleve
      because his is a poetics in which the affliction of this kind of
      lessness is transformed into a more or less tongue-in-cheek way of
      assuming a kind of subjective integrity. In the same dialogue, Hoccleve
      embarks on an extended digression complaining about coin clipping,
      noting that while the present stability of his mental health is
      indisputable, he is, like so many others, suffering from “feble
      moneie.”<span class="citation" data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn2"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> The worry in the digression
      is with the problem of coin washers devaluing the honest worker’s
      wages:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Manie a man this day, but thei golde weie,<br />
      Of men not wole it take ne resceiue,<br />
      And if it lacke his peis they wole it weiue.<br />
       <br />
      Howe may it holde his peis whanne it is wasshe<br />
      So that it lacke sumwhat in thiknese?<span class="citation"
      data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Two things are worth noting about Hoccleve’s fiduciary digression. It
      isn’t, for one, a complaint about usury. As Jacques Le Goff has
      discussed at length, usury is “a sin <em>against nature</em>,”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="moneylife"><a href="#fn4"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> insofar as the usurer
      transgresses the “natural” laws of just exchange by charging interest –
      performing, that is, a kind of unnatural reproduction by making money by
      means of money.<span class="citation" data-cites="moneylife"><a
      href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> Hoccleve’s digression comes
      to this moral-economic problem from a different position: his complaint
      isn’t directed at those making unjust gains so much as he laments a much
      broader and more insidious devaluation that accompanies money’s lost
      integrity (or “thickness”). The clipped coin is a circulating object
      whose devaluation has occurred prior to its falling into the hand of the
      recipient: it testifies to a kind of epidemic of falsehood and a
      concerningly widespread perversion of truth that fails to provide the
      complainer with a phobically cherrypicked Other to direct their
      resentment towards. This also, then, tells us something about the
      function of complaint for Hoccleve: the complainer laments, uselessly, a
      condition of exchange from the position of one whose affliction in a
      sense precedes him.</p>
      <p>As I will elaborate further in chapter four, complaint for Hoccleve
      begins from the position of the depressive – in which (as Sigmund Freud
      describes in <em>Mourning and Melancholia</em>)<span class="citation"
      data-cites="SE14"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span> a subject fails to move past
      some sort of loss in part because they cannot quite articulate
      <em>what</em> it is they have lost. In psychoanalytic theory, the
      enunciation of this loss transforms it into something else. Complaint is
      a discourse which sustains itself against and through its own lack or
      fallenness, unfolding according to a kind of inverted melancholic logic
      in which the complainer’s reproach radiates outward, making a world of
      its depressive symptom. It thus provides the complainer with a perverse
      kind of stability, a grounds of identification insofar as the complainer
      is in a sense committed to always already lacking something and is also,
      because of this, never to blame for the conditions producing that lack.
      This dissertation takes interests in such scenes, in which a rhythm of
      enjoyment emerges in tandem with a kind of dogged refusal to be
      satisfied. It attends to those subjects who, like the little boy Freud
      describes in <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em> who, when making his
      toys disappear “with an expression of interest and satisfaction,”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="freudBeyond"><a href="#fn7"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span> remain stubbornly at the site
      of lack, as if faithful to a <em>pleasure in loss</em> that precedes and
      remains mysteriously in excess of the pleasure one might derive in the
      satisfaction of some desire.</p>
      <p>The appearance of this kind of subject position has a particular
      character in medieval literary texts in part because of the presence of
      a kind of ethical pull: no subject can be sustained on refusal alone,
      but in order to imagine moving from unethical not-doing to ethical doing
      the positing of a subject who refuses becomes necessary, if also
      necessarily overcome. As D. Vance Smith has put it, melancholia in the
      Middle Ages “demanded a deep responsibility: there still had to be
      something that resolved or transcended it – that would terminate
      it.”<span class="citation" data-cites="smithdying"><a href="#fn8"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span> This is in part because in
      the medieval moral imaginary, melancholia was really <em>acedia</em> –
      the sin of sloth. <em>Acedia</em> begins as a peculiarly intellectual
      affliction, a state of listlessness particularly afflicting early monks.
      M.B. Pranger has argued that for influential monastic thinkers like
      Anselm of Canterbury sloth performs an important function in the
      monastic form of life’s dialectical “poetics” of melancholic despair and
      mystical rapture. This is the dynamic that gives shape to the
      <em>contemptus mundi</em> meditation, for instance, which Pranger argues
      for reading as an “exercise in despair about oneself and the world,”
      which “sets the pattern of the monastic life, thereby preventing the
      self from dissolving into the vagueness and diffusion of the world and
      preparing it for ‘living the way one reads.’”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="pranger2003"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></span> Slothful despair of the
      world, one might say, is the symptom of the monastic form of life: it is
      at once a vexing byproduct of monasticism and a foothold for its
      sustenance. <em>Acedia</em> constitutes an affective reference point
      from which the erotic excess of divine rapture might be occasioned,<span
      class="citation" data-cites="pranger2003"><a href="#fn10"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span> a position to which one
      continually returns in order to transcend again.</p>
      <p>Sloth, then, might be seen in terms of a kind of suspension of
      satisfaction: that it anticipates – without guaranteeing – that
      satisfaction is precisely what occasions the articulation of desire.<a
      href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> It’s when that satisfaction is
      suspended indefinitely – when, in a sense, that suspension becomes a
      kind of theft – that it begins to slip into sinfulness. One may recall,
      for instance, the scene on the “half acre” in <em>Piers Plowman</em>, in
      which several pilgrims’ refusal to work becomes transmogrified into a
      prosopopoeic “Waster.” Here, sloth takes on a distinct form of
      expression in the context of the late feudal estate, articulating a
      refusal or lack of will to work as a will to waste:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Thanne gan Wastour to wrathen hym and wolde have yfoughte,<br />
      And to Piers the Plowman he profrede his glove.<br />
      A Bretoner, a braggere, abosted Piers alse<br />
      And bad hym go pissen with his plowgh, forpyned sherewe!<br />
      `Wiltow or neltow, we wol have oure wille,<br />
      And of thi flour and of thi flesshe fecche whanne us liketh,<br />
      And maken us murye thermyde, maugree thi chekes.’<span class="citation"
      data-cites="langlandB"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What begins as a series of refusals or excuses to avoid participating
      in the economy of the half acre of land that Piers conscripts the
      pilgrims to work in exchange for showing them the way to find “Truth”
      here becomes symptomatic of a far more aggressive desire. The will to
      waste, here, explicitly demands the elimination of the landowning
      plowman. Specifically addressing Piers, Waster threatens to consume
      “<em>thi</em> flour,” “<em>thi</em> flesshe,” to “maugree <em>thi</em>
      cheekes.” Prosopopoeia has a distinctly political dimension here: it
      ascribes malicious intention and positive agency to a lack of will or
      action. It translates a lack of action into an act of <em>refusal</em>,
      and, in the political economy of the half acre’s “experiment in agrarian
      utopian collectivity”<span class="citation" data-cites="millersplit"><a
      href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></span> this act of refusal becomes
      expressive of distinctly classed anxieties.</p>
      <p>As monastic texts became more available in translation, too, their
      “poetics” became entangled with the political and social concerns of
      urban European aristocrats and the emergent bourgeoisie. Amy Appleford
      has traced some of the ways in which monastic ethics and practices such
      as the <em>contemptus mundi</em> and <em>meditatio mortis</em> became
      adapted into a kind of “lay asceticism, responsive to the desires of a
      pious, educated, and privileged lay Londoners to participate in the
      perfectionist life of enclosed religious.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="applefordlearning"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span> Instructively,
      the class character of this laicized asceticism in fourteenth and
      fifteenth century death culture may also in a sense purge the
      melancholic element from these contemplative practices. As dying a “good
      death” became a concern not only for the religious contemplative but for
      the merchant class, the poetics of lay asceticism as articulated in
      texts like the fifteenth century <em>Visitation of the Sick</em>, public
      murals which combined word and image like Lydgate’s <em>Dance of
      Death</em>, and public projects like the almshouse of the wealthy
      merchant Richard Whittington, the poetics of lay asceticism appear to be
      less characterized by the neoplatonic “circularity” described by Pranger
      than by an investment in futurity and class reproduction. The almshouse,
      Whittington’s last gift to the city of London which he commissioned on
      his deathbed, was in many ways a symptom of “an increased desire for
      social control inherent in alms being given only to the ‘deserving’
      poor,” emphasizing that “only ‘discrete and humble’ poor should be
      admitted to the house.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="applefordlearning"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>What may be observed in both of these scenes is a parsing of sloth
      from melancholia that occurs as the character of the suspended
      satisfaction in <em>acedia</em> in a sense changes ownership. In the
      monastic context, <em>acedia</em> is symptomatic not only in the sense
      of being a “side effect” of a form of devotion, but also in the sense
      that <em>acedia</em> is itself something which can be both accomodated
      and put to work by an ethical life. In the case of the late feudal
      figure of the “waster,” however, the enjoyment that is suspended belongs
      to somebody: with the figures of the wage laborer and the almsbeggar,
      <em>acedia</em> has become a form of theft and delinquency. This is the
      anxiety expressed by Langland’s half-acre as the lack of volition to
      work fails to be accomodated by the political economy of the late feudal
      estate with a productive rhythm of enjoyment and thus can only be
      expressed as death-driven, that is, as an aggressive desire to devour
      the landowner that threatens the social formation itself. The scene is
      also instructive for its demonstration of how the moralized lexicon of
      the Middle Ages often leads texts to articulate their anxieties about
      changing social conditions in terms which attribute structural problems
      to one or another “bad” actor – the waster, the Jew, the sodomite –
      whose sinfulness appears at once as a result of a constituent moral
      weakness and as a distinctly malicious aggressivity towards the social
      body.</p>
      <p>This is often the function of prosopopoeia in the late medieval text,
      as the dualistic psychomachia characteristic of late antique allegorical
      texts like Prudentius’s <em>Psychomachia</em> and Boethius’s
      <em>Consolatio Philosophiae</em> finds new life in the representation of
      the different social anxieties of the later middle ages. In the process,
      these texts represent a new set of phobic “objects.” This is part of the
      story I tell in my discussion of Heldris of Cornwall’s <em>Roman de
      Silence</em> in chapter two. Much of <em>Silence</em>’s drama unfolds
      according to a conflict between Nature and Nurture, as the titular
      character continuously finds themself at various impasses resulting from
      the misalignment of their “nurtured” and their “natural” sex. Here,
      “nurture” is represented as something of an allegorical “bad object,” a
      placeholder for anxieties about sexual and gender deviance which are
      ultimately to be understood as sinful for their unnatural abuse of the
      pleasure principle vis-à-vis a withholding of satisfaction. I argue that
      the text’s ultimately homophobic and cissexist ideological commitments
      are articulated in its alignment of sexuality and pleasure with
      “nature,” characterizing Silence’s transgender embodiment as always a
      refusal of pleasure and a withholding of satisfaction that the romance’s
      demand for a happy, reparative ending functions to render
      unsustainable.</p>
      <p>Here, too, narrative begins from the melancholic: the departure from
      nature haunts the story in such a way that the generic imperative
      towards a resolution of the romance’s prosopopoeic conflict requires
      that this “loss” be felt and repaired. This repair itself, though, may
      also in a sense be melancholic in the sense that it elaborately stages
      the assumption of a sex on the back of a <em>renunciation</em> of
      another, as if to suggest that, for Silence, the desirability of the
      masculine position ultimately forecloses identification with it.
      Relatedly, in classical psychoanalytic theory, melancholia gives form to
      a rather fundamental position of the psychoanalytic subject: it is
      constitutive of the post-Oedipal subject’s assumption of a sex and
      testifies to the libidinal precariousness that attends to that
      assumption in the first place. After the early observation of the
      intimacy of melancholia with identification in 1917’s <em>Mourning and
      Melancholia</em> – specifically, in the depressive’s unconscious
      identification with the lost object – beginning in 1923 with <em>The Ego
      and the Id</em>, Freud would come to explicitly identify the ego’s
      post-Oedipal assumption of a sexed identity in melancholic terms:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>We succeeded in explaining the painful disorder of melancholia by
      supposing that an object which was lost has been set up again inside the
      ego – that is that an object-cathexis has been replaced by an
      identification. At that time, however, we did not appreciate the full
      significance of this process and did not know how common and how typical
      it is. Since then we have come to understand that this substitution has
      a great share in determining the form taken by the ego and that it makes
      an essential contribution towards building up what is called its
      “character.”<span class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn16"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It’s here where Freudian bisexuality – the theory that every human
      contains characteristics of both sexes – moves from the polymorphous to
      the normative, as the assumption of a male or female sex happens on the
      back of an identification that is also a renunciation.<a href="#fn17"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
      Here, the ego is tasked with internalizing aspects of the abandoned
      object in order to wean, so to speak, the id off of its dogged
      attachments. If, for instance, when abandoning my erotic attachment to
      my lover, I come to internalize certain of their characteristics –
      perhaps I grow to really like one of their favorite records, or catch
      myself repeating certain of their trademark expressions – these
      identifications don’t act to undermine my sex but rather to ensure it
      survives my letting go of my attachment to them.<a href="#fn18"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
      The ego, here, begins to appear as a “precipitate of abandoned
      object-cathexes” which remain within it as the scars of the object
      relations it has survived.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>This problematic informs Judith Butler’s diagnosis of
      cis-heterosexual identity as inherently melancholic: “gender
      identification,” they write, “is a kind of melancholia in which the sex
      of the prohibited object is internalized as a prohibition.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="butlerTrouble"><a href="#fn20"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></span> Butler’s reading attends to
      a prohibition within this prohibition. If the assumption of a sex is
      attended by the “internalization of an internal moral directive”
      prompted by the incest taboo, then “the taboo against homosexuality must
      <em>precede</em> the heterosexual incest taboo,”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="butlerTrouble"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></span> since in
      Freud’s account the coincidence of identification with and desire for
      the object is necessarily pre-Oedipal and thus pre-linguistic, a
      phenomonenon characteristic of the narcissism of early childhood in
      which difference is not yet comprehensible. This prohibition is, as I’ll
      discuss further in the chapter two, one shared by <em>Silence</em>’s
      narrative when the foreclosure of homosexual desire puts Silence in the
      double-bind of having to choose between an impossible (because of his
      lack of a penis) sexual relationship with the queen or accepting the
      idea of playing the “passive” role in a sexual encounter.</p>
      <p>A story like <em>Silence</em>’s, then, poses problems to the
      narrative of identification articulated by the Oedipal family structure,
      speaking to the way that identification proceeds alongside the
      repression of a violence which casts a darker hue on the story’s
      reparative fantasy. Silence’s “refusal” of satisfaction ultimately
      functions within the romance narrative to make the case for his
      transgender identification being one which impossibilizes his
      flourishing as a desiring subject. Silence, ultimately, becomes an
      apparatus of the narrative’s reactionary ideological commitment to
      “Nature.” As both <em>Silence</em> and Chaucer’s <em>Prioress’s
      Tale</em> – which I read in chapter three – demonstrate, this family
      structure enacts this kind of violent instrumentalization even – perhaps
      even especially – in those scenes where it isn’t perfectly reflected in
      the form of an archetypal heterosexual nuclear family unit. The
      <em>Prioress’s Tale</em>’s preoccupation with Marian theology underpins
      its phobic characterization of the Jews by way of its
      instrumentalization of the child, as the Prioress’s own fetishistic
      identification with both mother and child – a relation in which the
      mother’s psychotic identification with her loved object is so radical as
      to require its elimination – sacrifices its own loved object in order to
      preserve a fantasy of it.</p>
      <p>One assumption made by many critics of the <em>Tale</em>’s
      antisemitism is that the blood libel narratives it reproduces are, in a
      sense, prompted by the deaths of actual children which the narratives
      falsely attribute to a “bad object” in the form of the Jews. If such
      narratives can be described in terms of their emergence from a kind of
      melancholic structure, then, it is due to their inability or refusal to
      mourn those children. The narrative’s need to preserve an idealized
      image of the child prevents it from being able to ever move on from the
      loss, and the scene is returned to again and again without ever coming
      to terms with a reality more complicated and damning than can be
      explained by the racist projection of death-driven aggression onto a
      minority group. It’s in such cases that I think narrative’s departure or
      even resistance to a “melancholic structure” becomes important to keep
      track of: instead of introjecting the death-driven aggression towards
      the ambivalent aspects of its lost object, such narratives
      <em>project</em> these aspects onto another party altogether.</p>
      <p>This problematic informs Klein’s articulation of the “depressive
      position” as the fulcrum of neurotic subjectivity, which for her refers
      both to an actual moment of depressive self-reflection which the young
      child passes through in early development as well as a sort of affective
      reference point that stays with the subject throughout their life. For
      Klein, the depressive is the antidote to the paranoid psychosis of early
      infancy, a position in which the subject’s own death-driven aggression
      is “projectively identified” with the other. In “The Psychogenesis of
      Manic-Depressive States,” Klein observes how in her patients “paranoid
      fears and suspicions were reinforced as a defense against the depressive
      position” and describes the “depressive position” as “based on the
      paranoid state and genetically derived from it.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="LGR"><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></span> Depression is how the
      subject begins to reconcile herself with her own splitness; it names the
      moment when the subject begins to tarry with the ambivalence of the
      drive as constitutive of her own subjectivity instead of anxiously
      projecting its qualities onto everyone but herself in order to
      compartmentalize its erotic and death-driven components. As the
      dialectical complement to the binary thinking of the paranoid-schizoid
      position, depression is when we begin to accept that our loved objects
      can be ambivalent – that they can have both “good” and disturbing
      qualities at the same time, and that there can be a coexistence of love
      and hate in our relationships with them.</p>
      <p>There’s an important sense in which the resistance to the depressive
      position that Klein traces from a very early point in the individual
      subject’s history has a social component, finding expression in a larger
      societal investment in “running away” from (or striving to eliminate
      altogether) the depressive. We’ve seen this already with the response of
      Thomas’s friend, whose instinct is to immediately attempt to brush any
      question of the narrator’s mental instability under the rug. This
      allergy to the depressive and the pathological – and to affective and
      desiring positions which in some sense elide or subvert the pleasure
      principle – inform Jacques Lacan’s articulation in the 1960s of the
      Freudian super-ego in light of Kant’s categorical imperative. The
      super-ego, for Lacan, represents a “ferocious figure” which torments the
      neurotic subject with a “senseless, destructive, purely oppressive,
      almost always anti-legal morality,” reducing moral law to the simple
      imperative of “<em>You must.</em>”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="lacansem1"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span> This reduction of the law to
      the imperative is characterized by a kind of sadistic enjoyment that
      exceeds – or misrecognizes – the law. For Lacan, it’s this enjoyment
      which inheres both to the moralist and the trangressive hedonist, both
      of whom (as he argues in “Kant with Sade”) ultimately derive an
      enjoyment with respect to the law in such a way that ultimately
      reinforces it. On this telling, then, the super-ego is foremost an
      <em>imperative to enjoy</em> by which the subject is “reconstituted
      through alienation at the cost of being nothing but the instrument of
      jouissance.”<span class="citation" data-cites="lacanEcrits"><a
      href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>On the one hand, then, the melancholic might be seen as such an
      instrument – as a victim of her own super-ego’s sadistic imperatives
      directed back against her own ego. However, Klein’s emphasis on the
      developmental necessity of (and <em>resistance to</em>) the depressive
      position in terms of the child’s learning to love their loved object as
      an ambivalent “whole” as opposed <em>splitting</em> it into “good” and
      “bad” “part-objects”<span class="citation" data-cites="LGR"><a
      href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></span> suggests that there’s also a
      sense in which this imperative to enjoy – extrinsic to the subject –
      might be characterized in terms of a phobia of the depressive position,
      insofar as the depressive position introduces an element of ambivalence
      to enjoyment itself that leads to the subject on some level refusing
      this tyrannical imperative. It’s on this point that I take an interest
      in the literary experiments of poets like Chaucer and Hoccleve which
      explicitly locate their poetic subjects in the depressive position.</p>
      <p>Prompted, in part, by Leo Bersani’s reading of the Freudian “trait,”
      I argue in chapter three that in <em>The Book of the Duchess</em>
      Chaucer’s use of the melancholic symptom as a literary device in itself
      suggests a mode of identification that is distinctly non-Oedipal.
      Bersani’s re-reading of the Oedipus complex proceeds from the question
      of what it might mean to rethink Freudian identification in light of
      those (homosexual) forms of identification which don’t foreclose desire
      and in which identification isn’t coterminous with renunciation. In
      <em>Gender Trouble</em> Butler argues that the outcome of bisexuality in
      Freud’s account of the Oedipus complex in <em>The Ego and the Id</em> is
      the entrenchment of heterosexuality: if the boy desires his father, for
      instance, it is the result of a “feminine disposition,” thus making
      bisexuality a mere “coincidence of two heterosexual desires.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="butlerTrouble"><a href="#fn26"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></span> As Bersani emphasizes,
      though, Freud retains a certain amount of ambivalence about the basis of
      these “dispositions” themselves, noting that even if we do read his
      account of bisexuality here in terms of its reinforcement of the
      “binary,” heterosexual couple form, he “also institutes a mobility of
      desiring positions and a multiplicity of identities that make of the
      couple itself a unit in continuous dissolution.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="bersanirectum"><a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></span> As he argues in
      “Against Monogamy,” for Bersani there may be a sense in which
      identification can survive difference and detachment, and even derive a
      kind of pleasure from it, and he suggests a reading of the Oedipal scene
      in which what is at stake is</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>not how we preserve a relation to those [lost] objects, but rather,
      whether we will successfully, <em>and with pleasure</em>, move away
      from, abandon love-objects. This can be done only if the rival father,
      or the rival mother, for both the little boy and the little girl, is no
      longer seen either as a rival or as a parent, but rather as a seductive
      summons. He or she intrudes upon familial intimacy with a promise (and
      not merely the prohibitive threat Freud emphasizes) – the promise that
      if the child leaves the family it will have the narcissistic pleasure of
      finding itself in the world.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="bersanirectum"><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It’s this “narcissistic pleasure of finding oneself in the world,” in
      which difference is no longer a trauma but a “nonthreatening supplement
      to sameness”<span class="citation" data-cites="bersanirectum"><a
      href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></span> that Bersani posits as a
      basis for identification that is far more open-ended than the
      “heterosexual matrix” inferred by the classic reading of Freud one
      encounters again and again in both queer theory and the more
      conservative strains of clinical psychoanalysis.</p>
      <p>It’s Bersani’s aesthetic and “impersonally narcissistic” account of
      the subject who passes through the world seeking “inaccurate
      replications” of themself that might testify to their “already
      established at-homeness in the world”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="bersanirectum"><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></span> that I argue
      sheds a light on the function of “I” in <em>The Book of the
      Duchess</em>. Here, Chaucer centers the melancholic symptom as a
      literary device, utilizing it as a foothold of identification and an
      invitation to a kind of movement carried along by narcissistic
      recognitions that dictates the passage between its various nested
      narratives. It’s with the <em>Book</em> that we begin to arrive at a
      literary form proper to the depressive position as a “mode of
      enjoyment,” as an affective position whose open-endedness isn’t only
      conceivable as forever teetering on the brink of sin. It’s here, too,
      where this dissertation finally begins to arrive at an account of the
      “symptom” as a point of identification and solidarity as well as
      something along which we can begin, perhaps, to imagine a mode of
      enjoyment or form of life.</p>
      <p>When I turn to the poetry of Thomas Hoccleve in chapter four, I also
      turn to Lacan’s revised account of the symptom in his later work which,
      in his famous case study of James Joyce, articulates a sense in which
      the symptom is a kind of weaving together of the self. Hoccleve’s
      privileged symptomatic genre isn’t the dream poem but the complaint,
      which I argue he makes wholly his own. Complaint for Hoccleve is a
      (benignly) narcissistic genre: the “I” of Hoccleve’s texts <em>is</em>
      Hoccleve, and the emergence of these texts out of and beyond the
      depressive isn’t in the service of paranoid projection or the
      fetishization of some loved object. Rather, the complainer simply seeks
      to continue complaining.</p>

      Philippe Van Haute, who argues for reading a kind of epistemological
      break in Freud’s writing between the early analysis of hysteria and the
      later privileging of obsessional neurosis, psychosis, and the Oedipus
      complex. “As long as Freud considered infantile sexuality as essentially
      autoerotic,” Van Haute writes, “the Oedipus complex, as the formative
      complex of subjectivity in early childhood, was literally unthinkable”
      (<span class="citation" data-cites="vanhauteOedipus">Van Haute,
      <span>“Freud Against Oedipus?”</span></span>, 42). This changes in 1909,
      when Freud publishes <em>Notes Upon A Case of Obsessional Neurosis</em>
      (the “Rat Man” case study, <span class="citation"
      data-cites="SE10">Freud, <em>The Standard Edition of the Complete
      Psychological Works</em>, 1955</span>, 150-318). Whereas in earlier work
      (<em>Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria</em>, <em>Three
      Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</em>, both in <span class="citation"
      data-cites="SE7">Freud, <em>The Standard Edition of the Complete
      Psychological Works</em>, 1953</span>), “the sexual body as a
      constitutive field of forces with an ever-changing strength and
      intensity, which in principle never gives us any rest,” after 1909 this
      line of thought “becomes progressively inscribed in an Oedipal logic
      that concretizes the reference to the law (of the father),” as the
      “partial drives” become placed within phases of development that aim
      towards heterosexual object relations and the different
      psychopathologies are understood as “failed attempts to overcome the
      Oedipal problematic” (<span class="citation"
