    <h2>melancholia and desire in medieval literature</h2>
      <p>doctoral dissertation, 2023</p>
      <p>(for Grushenka)</p>
      <h3>abstract</h3>

	<p class="abstract">This dissertation draws a distinction between
	medieval and psychoanalytic representations of melancholia as something
	repressed on the level of narrative structure and as a subjective mode
	of enjoyment. In each chapter I explore a problematic that
	psychoanalysis has traditionally conceived in melancholic terms: gender,
	the object, and the symptom. I argue that melancholia offers a useful
	reference point for understanding not only how medieval literary texts
	articulate accounts of gender, ideology and the family, but also some of
	the uses late medieval English writers made of melancholic affect for
	their novel interpretations of genres such as the dream vision and the
	complaint. If melancholia is symptomatic, repressive and pathological, I
	argue that there may also be a sense in which this symptomaticity itself
	might be seen as constitutive of a subjective position through which
	otherwise repressed forms of self-knowledge and enjoyment might begin to
	be articulated.</p>
