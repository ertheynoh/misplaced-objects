    <h1>cate le bon, <em>pompeii</em></h1>
      <p>I love Cate Le Bon&#8217;s lyrics: the whimsical ambivalence, the
      deadpan, the sighs.
      Take &#8220;Miami,&#8221; which opens her 2019 record <em>Reward</em>:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Decorate your own discord, Miami<br/>
      Never be the same again, no way<br/>
      Falling skies that people uphold, move with me<br/>
      Love neglected by reward, okay  </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>&#8220;Miami&#8221; is an invitation to occupy dissonance, to be at
      home within the
      <a href="https://youtu.be/n2Xsu1q3cAw">impasses under
      hallway ceilings</a>; to adorn
      discord onto the world and to attach rhythm to collapsing optimisms. But
      this
      last line drops the imperative mode: does &#8220;reward&#8221; speak to
      the neglect of love
      or is reward itself that which does the neglecting? To reward someone for
      love
      is to provide a receipt for it. I reward my lover when I aim to extinguish
      desire by presuming to be able to satisfy it.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Okay&#8221; meets reward with deadpan, sitting somewhere between
      the breathless
      declaration of love and the realization that the person to whom I wish to
      declare my love isn&#8217;t there (cf. <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VMVZ1GZZs">"Daylight
      Matters"</a>). It&#8217;s the &#8220;okay&#8221; of
      someone who&#8217;s walked alongside love running on its own fumes. It
      expresses a
      detachment that remains within a scene, which acknowledges impasse without
      blinding itself to the fact that emergency hasn&#8217;t yet arrived. </p>

      <p>Stones and dirt recur with some regularity in Le Bon&#8217;s lyrics.
      One of my
      favorite songs from 2017&#8217;s <em>Crab Day</em>, <a
      href="https://youtu.be/mPOqElC1edA">&#8220;I was born on
      the wrong
      day&#8221;</a>, carries itself with a lighthearted
      militancy:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Oh, teach me words like faith<br/>
      Put all your details in the ground<br/>
      As if you don&#8217;t believe in stones<br/>
      I&#8217;m gonna cry in your mouth  </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>As if you don&#8217;t believe in stones! I love the wry aggression in
      these lines, the cuttingness of these tears that could just as easily be
      the death-driven matricidal piss of the Kleinian child betrayed by their
      &#8220;good&#8221; objects. The song, <a
      href="https://northerntransmissions.com/interview-with-cate-le-bon/" >it
      turns out</a>, was written in reference to Le Bon&#8217;s birthday being
      celebrated on the wrong day for the first six years of her life, a
      revelation all the more shattering for how it undermines the reliability
      of our parents to provide us with a reference point of certainty:
      &#8220;when you&#8217;re six years old you think that it&#8217;s the end
      of the world when you&#8217;re told that your birthday is a different one
      from the one you thought.&#8221;</p>

      <p><a
      href="https://catelebon.bandcamp.com/album/pompeii"><em>Pompeii</em></a>
      is at some remove from the earlier albums&#8217; preoccupation with
      pressing things into stones (or mugs, or chairs): &#8220;I&#8217;ve pushed
      love through the hourglass,&#8221; she sings on the title track,
      &#8220;Did you see me putting pain in a stone?&#8221; The album opener,
      &#8220;Dirt on the Bed,&#8221; likens love to sound, describing it as
      something that allows you to &#8220;reach without watching &#47; the
      switches on the wall,&#8221; and which &#8220;reinvents the surface &#47;
      of everything you touch.&#8221; The song recalls another from <em>Crab
      Day</em>, &#8220;Find Me,&#8221; in which the narrator haunts their
      lover&#8217;s home when they aren&#8217;t there, &#8220;glossing all your
      dirty furniture&#8221; and leaving handprints on the windows. Now the
      narrator themself is dirt, accumulating on the bed, stuck &#8220;on repeat
      &#47; without a function.&#8221; There&#8217;s an observation being made
      here about sublimation: we may only be able to get so far in squeezing
      things in or out of stones, but it&#8217;s in the process of our attempts
      to do so they accumulate as sand, dirt, and dust, reinventing
      surfaces.</p>

      <p>The image of bodies covered in ashes haunts the lilting synthpop of
      &#8220;Harbour.&#8221; When she introduced the song in Chicago on
      Valentine&#8217;s Day, she dedicated it to &#8220;the lovers&#8221; in the
      audience (&#8220;you&#8217;re supposed to say these kinds of things on
      Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8221;). In a <a
      href="https://genius.com/Cate-le-bon-harbour-lyrics">gloss</a> of the
      song, though, she&#8217;s said that the lyrics are about asking what one
      does in their final moment of being alive: &#8220;&#8216;What do you do in
      your final moment? What is your final gesture? Where do you run when you
      know there&#8217;s no point running?&#8217;&#8221; This is the love as
      compulsion to repeat, to return to the &#8220;harbour&#8221; of the
      lover&#8217;s embrace, perhaps against your better judgment (&#8220;Into
      your arms &#47; And I&#8217;m like a child&#8221;). Such compulsions and
      fallings speak, too, to the ways love and death have of bending time back
      upon itself, to the interchangeability of &#8220;life&#8221; and
      &#8220;night&#8221; and of days and minutes and memories and centuries:
      &#8220;What you said was nice &#47; when you said my face turned a memory
      &#47; [&#8230;] when you said my heart broke a century.&#8221;</p>

      <p>In the album&#8217;s final track, &#8220;Wheel,&#8221; the narrator
      bitterly reflects on a lover&#8217;s
      resistance to being taught &#8220;how to want a life&#8221; (&#8220;it
      takes more time than you&#8217;d
      tender&#8221;). But the song doesn&#8217;t leave us with the feeling of
      bitterness or
      depressive stultification as much as an ambivalent mixture of
      world-weariness
      and steadfastness:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>I could resign to the opulence<br/>
      Of abstract optimistic love<br/>
      Raise a glass in a season of ash<br/>
      And pour it over me  </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Love, like art, isn&#8217;t a romance but a work: it accumulates, like
      ash, rather
      than being captured by reward; it shifts the landscapes of worlds by
      reinventing
      their surfaces. This is the voice of someone who has survived love without
      forgetting its violence and hurt, but whose commitment to staying in its
      fray
      remains intact.</p>
