<h1 id="pretending-not">pretending not</h1>
<p>One of the hallmarks of Chaucer’s writing is its unreliable
narrators, the delight it takes in placing the reader at the mercy of
its own poor readers. Much of its humor comes from this — the dreamer in
the <em>The Book of the Duchess</em> groggily misreading Ovid or failing
to read between the lines of the Black Knight’s tale, for instance. In
that dream, the story is only able to continue so long as the dreamer
fails to connect the dots and deduce that the lover is dead: it’s upon
realizing this that the dreamer wakes up and the story ends.</p>
<p>I wonder: if the comedic is located in a kind of reflexive deflation
— in the staging of fantasy such that it appears, absurdly, as fantasy —
is there a sense in which the fictional is located in the refusal to
check one’s own facts — in <em>misreading</em>? I suspect that even for
the most realist and scrupulously-researched fiction, at some point you
have to refuse to know better, or act as though you don’t.</p>
<p>This is also, of course, one way of talking about ideology. One may
recall China Mièville’s sci-fi neo-noir <em>The City and the City</em>,
in which the denizens of two geographically overlapping nations
collectively participate in sustaining their respective imagined
communities by simply learning to “unsee” each other. The gimmick
doesn’t really hold your interest for very long, though — in part, I
suspect, because the novel is so humorless. I wonder if fiction can have
anything to say about ideology if it isn’t funny.</p>
<p>And I think what I mean by “funny” here is something like: a story
which, if it didn’t prompt laughter, would only appear schizophrenic:
the pieces wouldn’t fit together; it would be ruined because it fails to
provide a world for its own pretensions, which is exactly what made it
funny in the first place. Can a joke be funny if it can’t be ruined?</p>
<p>If China Mièville were a better writer, perhaps <em>The City and the
City</em> would have been a comedic novel, rather than merely a gimmicky
one. I think “3:30,” a tiny little story in Parker Young’s recent
collection <em>Cheap Therapist Says You’re Insane</em>, just kind of
“gets it.” Here’s how it begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walking the city grid at 3:30pm with all the other unemployed people.
We pretend not to notice each other. It’s a deal we struck when we got
tired of explaining. (162)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideology yields to exhaustion. An epistemic downward spiral: we’re
too tired to explain; we know nothing. As the narrator’s grandmother
believed, people all have the ability to receive premonitions, but
“avoid them because they’re mostly unbearable,” avoiding the truth so
well that they don’t even know they’re avoiding it anymore.</p>
<p>But they’re still, on some level, always <em>pretending</em>. The
unconscious always knows better, or whatever. Fantasy pretends not to.
It interprets without consideration, after a certain point, of questions
like <em>how do you know?</em> “This is why I’ve failed so far in my
career to write essays,” the narrator explains, “I never provide the
appropriate details.”</p>
<p>Pretending becomes humorous when it is contradicted: when the
pretender appears in a world which neglects to provide those details.
The narrator imagines, at the drug store, that a “ne’er-do-well” could,
hypothetically, put poison on the tops of the deodorant containers,
killing clueless shoppers without anyone knowing the cause. “I ask to
speak to the manager.” The world fails to supply the details that would
make the scenario at all plausible. “Get lost,” they’re told.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I look at him with a look that says, you just blew a fucking
million-dollar idea. It’s a look I learned from television, where it
appears with a surprising and almost sinister regularity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story has now become a situation. It’s become sitcom, a genre
whose characters are “selfish and deranged, delicious micromenaces to
normalcy and etiquette who nonetheless enter each episode with their
worlds in tact.” Those words are <a
href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/08/seinfeld-rewatch-close-read.html">Lauren
Jackson’s</a>, who calls attention in particular to the whiteness of
such characters — in <em>Seinfeld</em>, in <em>Friends</em> — and to the
ways in which Black characters appear in these television shows as
“agents of public decency,” as avatars of a world that fails to supply
the details. I think, too, of the blank stare of the Latinx diner
waitress at the beginning of <a href="philip.html"><em>Listen Up
Philip</em></a>.</p>
<p>Here, though, the world that fails to supply the appropriate details
that would sustain our fantasies is one in which everyone is just
unemployed and broke. Flailing for a job. Trying, and failing, to
gesture towards something like a “normal” — employed — life.</p>
<p>Our narrator proceeds to sprinkle sugar on the deodorants, to make
the case for the job they’ve proposed that only they can fill, that is,
to be the one who checks the tops of the deodorants for poison. They’re
kicked out, screaming, because now they’ve remembered that they’d
actually needed to buy deodorant, and now can’t. “Fortunately, everyone
outside pretends not to notice.”</p>
