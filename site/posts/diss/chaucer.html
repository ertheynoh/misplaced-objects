<h1 id="two-positions-of-the-object-in-chaucer">Two positions of the
object in Chaucer</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, gender appears melancholically insofar as it
is ultimately posed as an object cause of desire upon being staged as
lost. It’s in the course of that staging, too, though, that the subject
in question becomes a kind of object, a “registering apparatus” not only
of the narrative’s constituent contradictions and ideological
investments but also of those of contemporary critics seeking to make
claims about the reading of “transness” historically. It’s this
alienated condition of the literary subject as an object of narrative –
in which the subject appears only as a form of appearance of a desire
that is not their own, and whose subjective disorganization and
reparation is contingent upon the turnings of a narrative outside of
their control – that the present chapter begins from. As I’ll elaborate,
gender appears within psychoanalytic discourse as the symptom of the
melancholic theory of desire that is most infamously outlined in Freud’s
account of the Oedipus complex, in which the subject <em>identifies</em>
with what they’ve <em>lost</em> in the formation of the ego. Queer and
trans desire, of course, substantially complicate this account, if not
by negating it completely then by indicating some of the ways gay and
trans subjects introduce certain plot holes to this narrative.</p>
<p>It’s with all of this in mind that I visit two scenes in the writing
of Geoffrey Chaucer. <em>The Prioress’s Tale</em>, I argue, hinges on
the question of the child as an “object” in the Lacanian sense of the
term – as a “cause of desire” who functions as a symptom of the family
form itself. This symptomaticity, though, takes on a particular form
within the context of the Marian spirituality in which the Prioress is
steeped. It’s the erotic tendency of Marian spirituality, specifically
as it’s articulated in the attachment between mother and child, out of
which the genocidally antisemitic affects of the tale emerge. There is
another side to Chaucer’s writing that I’d also like to address,
however. When I turn to <em>The Book of the Duchess</em>, I ask what a
different orientation towards loss might look like, in which melancholic
loss isn’t manically denied, covered over, or repaired but something
which might occasion a kind of enjoyment. Are we only ever the outcomes
of our tragically melancholic identifications or is there a sense in
which loss can itself be pleasurable?</p>
<h2 id="voice-and-death-spasm-the-prioresss-tale">Voice and death spasm:
<em>The Prioress’s Tale</em></h2>
<p><em>The Prioress’s Tale</em> jarringly prompts the question of the
“lost object” in part because of how it demonstrates the violence
implicit in the refusal or inability to mourn. It recounts a baldly
racist blood libel story in which the cold-blooded murder of a little
Christian boy at the hands of a mob of Jews is followed by a miracle in
which, despite having had his vocal chords severed, the boy continues to
sing his devotion to the Virgin Mary until his body can be given a
proper Christian burial – and of course, those taken to be responsible
for his murder can be executed. In an influential (and at the time
provocative) reading of the tale, Aranye Fradenburg articulated a
critical imperative with respect to Chaucer’s poem that I take to be
axiomatic: that to understand the <em>Prioress’s Tale</em>, we have to
be able to describe its <em>fictionality</em>. Its fiction is founded
upon a melancholic repression of Christian violence that is projected
onto the phobic object of the Jew: “Mourning in the <em>Prioress’s
Tale</em>,” she writes, “is most profoundly mourning for the losses
inflicted by Christian culture on itself, its self-repressions and
self-silencings.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="fradenburgprioress"><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The importance of being able to situate the story in terms of its
unprocessed sense of loss is not bound to the formal analysis of the
story itself. Work by critics like Steven Kruger<span class="citation"
data-cites="krugerspectraljew"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> and Anthony
Bale<span class="citation" data-cites="balebook"><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span> have been important for
illustrating the extent to which the fantasies of late medieval
antisemitic propaganda are purely ideological because after a certain
point antisemitic narratives didn’t even need the presence of its “bad
objects” – actual Jews – to continue circulating and developing. As Bale
shows, despite the fact that England had more or less successfully
expelled all of its Jews in 1290, “antisemitism, unlike Judaism, did not
disappear;”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rather, it prospered. Old themes were sustained and embellished
(ritual murder, the mocking image of the Jewish nose) and new themes
emerged (in particular surrounding the Jews’ imputed abuse of the
Eucharistic wafer). Such discourses permeated Latin chronicles,
theological treatises, sermons, vernacular poems, ecclesiastical art and
architecture, drama and marginalia […].<span class="citation"
data-cites="balebook"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The persistence of such propaganda independent of its phobic objects
doesn’t, of course, indicate that it doesn’t bear on them. Stories like
the <em>vitae</em> of William of Norwich and Hugh of Lincoln (the latter
of whom the Prioress pays tribute at the end of her tale) circulated
widely enough that they helped to provide justification and motivation
for pogroms and genocidal expulsions like that which occurred in 1290.
Understanding the tale’s fictionality – the ways, that is, in which its
investment in the representation of its phobic objects exceeds the real
objects which occasion it in the first place – requires taking seriously
the fact that such fictions function in response to and in anticipation
of real violence. It requires, in other words, taking seriously the
tale’s <em>ideology</em>. As recent work by critics like Heather Blurton
and Hannah Johnson have emphasized, the <em>Prioress’s Tale’s</em>
fiction is not Chaucer’s alone, but is situated in this broader network
of antisemitic propaganda, and the recurring critical impulse to
speculate about the tale’s “missing source” often serves to obscure its
embeddedness within this network. Chaucer’s source, they write, “is not
‘unknown’ at all, but rather ubiquitous.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="blurton2017"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Moreover, readings like those of Fradenburg and Bruce Holsinger<span
class="citation" data-cites="holsingerprioress"><a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span> bring into view not only the
centrality of anti-Jewish violence to the <em>Prioress’s Tale</em> but
also the intimacy of this violence with the dark side of reproductive
futurism: the function of Marian theology in the tale and others like it
is to paranoiacally project responsibility for the violence Christian
culture inflicts on its own children onto an Other.<span
class="citation" data-cites="fradenburgprioress"><a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span> What such propaganda brings
into view especially dramatically is that if, as Lee Edelman famously
put it, within such a culture “the sacralization of the Child […]
necessitates the sacrifice of the queer,” <em>then it also requires the
sacrifice of the child</em> to the same symbolic order which sacralizes
it.<span class="citation" data-cites="nofuture"><a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span> In the <em>Prioress’s
Tale</em>, this sacrifice happens in large part on the level of the
voice. Often, the “voice” is taken to be something that is more or less
self-present, autonomous – the voice can be silenced or restored,
sometimes, it needs to be “listened to,” allowed to speak for itself.<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Part of what’s discomfiting in the
<em>Prioress’s Tale</em> is the way it disturbs this self-presence.</p>
<p>This disturbance is in part a result of historical difference. In
modern parlance, the voice is often closely associated with
<em>agency</em>, itself a concept steeped in historiographical and
ethical connotations which, as Walter Johnson has critiqued in the New
Social History’s treatment of slavery, so often smuggle “a notion of the
universality of a liberal notion of selfhood” into the very scenes that
the notion of agency was initially defined <em>against</em>.<span
class="citation" data-cites="johnson2003"><a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span> In the <em>Prioress’s
Tale</em>, the question of the voice is in part posed on the back of the
tale’s fetishization of “song.” As Bruce Holsinger has argued, this
fetishization amounts to an exploitation of commonplace assumptions
about the apolitical nature of musical sonority: the tale “exploits its
reader’s assumption that musical sonority somehow exceeds the temporal
realm in which it is produced – and thus resists political imbrication
and, by extension, historicist analysis.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="holsingerprioress"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span> Reading the
tale from the perspective of the text’s violence – its genocidally
reparative affect with respect to otherness and its latent
aggressiveness towards what it purports to sanctify in the service of
that reparativity – also requires calling into question certain
ideological assumptions about the self-presence and self-transparency of
the voice itself.</p>
<p>One of the more striking features of Chaucer’s characterization of
the Prioress is her oral fixation. Perhaps no other character in the
<em>Tales</em> has such interesting eating habits: in the <em>General
Prologue</em>, the prioress is characterized as prim and uptight, with a
“faire and fetis,” if insular, command of French and impeccable table
manners. Chaucer takes care to note that “She leet no morsel from her
lips falle”<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></span> as she eats her meals, and
as someone who takes a special delight in politeness and the maintenance
of a clean upper lip: “In curteisie was set ful muchel hir lest. / Hir
over-lippe wyped she so clene That in hir coppe that was no ferthyng
sene / Of grece, what she dronken hadde her draughte.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Her moral character is
represented in terms of a deep aversion to waste, whether it be in the
form of a stray crumb of food<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span> or a waste of
life. We’re told, for instance, that she would cry at the sight of a
dead mouse<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"

characterized by an economy of nourishment in which nothing is wasted,

to her neurotically selected meals for her little dogs.</p>
<p>This is accompanied by language of fullness and plenitude: her smile
is “ful symple and coy”<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></span> and the mouth

href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span> this could easily be a
description of a young eligible lady of respectable birth. The language
of fertility here, however, is just as striking for the childishness of
the woman to which it is applied, who cries over dead mice and at
imagined scenarios in which someone kills her little dogs. Striking,
too, though, is Chaucer’s attention to the Prioress’s voice: her French
is notable not only for her linguistic competence but also for her
accent, and her nose is distinguished by the monastic song which
resonate through it.</p>
<p>As the prioress insists in the prayer to the Virgin that serves as
the basis of her prologue, the praise of God can be “performed” even by
the youngest of children. The lines here are somewhat ambiguous: the
praise of the lord can be performed not only by “men of dignitee, / But
by the mouth of children thy bountee / Parfourned is, for on the brest
soukynge / Somtyme shewen they thyn heriynge.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></span> The lines are
somewhat semantically ambiguous, in part because of the ambiguity of the
act of “performing praise” itself, which carries with it a question of
political theology. What sort of speech act is “praise,” one might ask,
and what does its performance bring into being or enact? Of more
pressing concern to the present writing, however, is the question of the
act itself, and of the mouths of the nursing children who praise God.
“On the brest soukynge” may describe a stage in one’s life where sucking
is mutually exclusive to speaking, but the prioress’s wording also
suggests that the act of sucking is itself a performance of praise,
perhaps even itself an attempt at interpretation. In the tale’s
prologue, the prioress identifies her own voice with that of the
pre-linguistic infant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My konnyng is so wayk, O blisful Queene,<br />
For to declare thy grete worthynesse<br />
That I ne may the weighte nat susteene;<br />
But as a child of twelf month oold, or lesse,<br />
Right so fare I, and therfore I yow preye,<br />
Gydeth my song that I shal of yow seye.<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already, a concept of childhood is being put to work by way of a
theory of the voice: the pre-linguistic infant speaks to the prying
apart of praise from linguistic signification itself. “Praise,” here,
doesn’t refer to any particular speech act or performance, but is
itself, in a sense, an object. The suggestion is that the
<em>speaking</em> of praise is an aftereffect of “praise” itself, a
reverberation of something more or less indifferent to the lips from
which it is uttered.</p>
<p>This identification with the child’s pre-linguistic voice is an
important component of the text’s ideological investments, and it may be
that any account of the <em>Prioress’s Tale’s</em> representation of
racial chauvinism or childhood must proceed from how the text
understands what Mladen Dolar terms “the voice object.” For Dolar, the
voice functions not as a testament to the presence of the speaking being
but instead marks a “rupture in the middle of the full presence”<span
class="citation" data-cites="dolarvoice"><a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></span> of that being, insofar as,
linguistically, the voice is to be distinguished from language as
something which “<em>does not contribute to making sense</em>.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="dolarvoice"><a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></span> This distinction, for Dolar,
is dialectical: if the voice is often understood to be
<em>expressive</em>, or to bear witness to something, this
expressiveness is itself an outcome of a “retroactive construction,” an
<em>interpretation</em> of what is otherwise senseless: “it is only
through language, via language, by the symbolic, that there is
voice.”<span class="citation" data-cites="dolarvoice"><a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></span> This ascription of meaning,
of course, happens in logical time:<span class="citation"
data-cites="lacanEcrits"><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></span> the voice, in
Dolar’s telling, takes on meaning the moment it is <em>heard</em> and
its reception determines its fate.</p>
<p>One may recall, for instance, Freud’s famous account in <em>Beyond
the Pleasure Principle</em> of the game played by a little boy who
throws his toys out of sight. Each time he throws the toy, he lets out a
cry of “`o-o-o-o’, accompanied by an expression of interest and
satisfaction,” which the mother interprets as an attempt at articulating
the German word <em>fort</em> (“gone”).<span class="citation"
data-cites="freudBeyond"><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></span> The second half
of the game proceeds entirely from this moment, in which the cry is
interpreted as a <em>demand</em> that the object return. Though the
return of the toy and the joyful proclamation of <em>da</em> (“there”)
is marked by “greater pleasure,” the game of disappearance is the part
which is “repeated untiringly as a game in itself.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="freudBeyond"><a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></span> The game is significant for
Freud for marking a kind of enjoyment of loss that is distinct from
satisfaction and pleasure itself: the child’s “great cultural
achievement” lies not in the successful communication with the mother
but in the “instinctual renunciation […] which he had made in allowing
his mother to go away without protesting.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="freudBeyond"><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></span> The game also,
though, marks that enjoyment as an excess, with the moment that marks
the split between the two halves of the game having been provided by the
voice-object which from the moment it appears is transformed
retroactively. Regardless of what occasions the cry, Dolar writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the moment it assumes the place of the addressee, the moment the
other is provoked and interpellated by it, the moment it responds to it,
<em>scream retroactively turns into appeal</em>, it is interpreted,
endowed with meaning, it is transformed into a speech addressed to the
other, it assumes the first function of speech: to address the other and
elicit an answer.<span class="citation" data-cites="dolarvoice"><a
href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The voice object, then, would seem to precede the subject herself,
voicing her splittedness in the rupture that appears in its retroactive
acquisition of meaning in the articulation of a language which precedes
it. What’s striking in the Prioress’s prologue, though, is the elision
of the distinction between the voice-object itself and “praise”: by
identifying her own voice with that of the pre-linguistic infant, the
interpellative moment is stretched back to precede the voice itself,
glossing over the rupture of presence which the voice object marks. In
her assumption of the child’s voice, in other words, the voice of the
child himself is already in a sense silenced.</p>
<p>The tale begins in a “greet citee” in an unspecified country in
“Asia,” where among an otherwise Christian populace a Jewry is supported
by the patronage of a local lord with a love of usury and villainous
profiteering.<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a

of the story comes from among these children: a “litel clergeon,” – a
future clerk in the making (the Prioress even emotionally invokes the
presence of Saint Nicholas, patron of clerks: “ay, when I remembre on
this mateere, / Seint Nicholas stant evere in my presence”)<span

his widow mother to show a special reverence for the Virgin. The child’s
habits precede him: every day he walks to the school he passes an image
of Mary, and whenever he passes an image of Mary he kneels and says his
<em>Ave Maria</em> and goes on his way.<span class="citation"

song:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>At the center of this little <em>vita</em> in miniature is the
emphasis on routine, repetition, and ritual; the little clergeon is
passionate about having a <em>habitus</em>, and takes to singing the
song twice a day, every day, on his way back and forth from school. The
poem takes a certain pleasure in repetition in the first part of this
little <em>vita</em>: there’s the repetition of “little” – the “litel
scole,” the “litel child” with his “litel book lernynge” – as well as
the emphasis on habit and doing things by rote – the memorization of
songs, the routine of walking through the Jewish ghetto every day to go
to school. The word “throte” appears four times in the short tale; only
in the stanza above is it used as an end word, rhyming, here, with
“rote” and “note.”</p>
<p>The detail is perhaps notable, if only for the irony with which the
song quite literally becomes stuck in the child’s throat. The Jews,
apparently sick of hearing the child skipping through their neighborhood
singing <em>Alma redemptoris</em>, are goaded by “the serpent
Sathanas”<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a

<p>There’s a striking temporal compression that seems to occur in these
lines: Jesus whispers in the mother’s ear, we suppose, where her child’s
corpse lies; this happens upon her exhausting the ghetto of Jews to
implore and, presumably, walking past the latrine in which he’s been
disposed. Curiously, the referent of line 605’s inaugural “that” –
presumably, the revelation of the child’s location – seems to have been
elided. Christ puts – <em>something</em> – in the mother’s thought
within a “little space” which coincides with her physical proximity to
the latrine in which her child’s corpse has been disposed. It’s at this
point that she emits a cry and the cry is answered, as the child’s
corpse suddenly sits itself upright and, despite having its vocal cords
severed, bursts into song.</p>
<p>In what follows, the local Christians gather around the scene to
“wondre upon this thyng,” fetching the child out of the latrine. The
Jews presumed to be responsible for killing the child are bound and
sentenced to death,<span class="citation"

data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></span> is carried to
the nearest abbey. There, the abbot sprinkles some water on the child
and asks him to explain how he’s continued to sing despite his throat
being cut. The child recounts a vision in which he is visited by the
Virgin, who instructs him to continue singing his song “in…
deyynge,”<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a

</blockquote>
<p>At this point the abbot gently removes the grain, allowing the child
to die peacefully in the church. The dilation of the actual process of
dying in order to suspend the instant of death itself that occurs here
is in stark contrast to the way this suspension occurs in <em>The Book
of the Duchess</em>: rather than being stolen from view by the
scaffolding of the fiction, here it’s dramatically staged, ritualized
and <em>witnessed</em>. Heather Blurton and Hannah Johnson have written
on the similarities between <em>The Prioress’s Tale</em> and other
antisemitic ritual murder stories, noting that in such stories “the
ritual production of the miracle”<span class="citation"
data-cites="blurton2017"><a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></span> is at least as
central to the narrative as the murder itself, and that both elements
are inextricably linked by a body that refuses to remain hidden.</p>
<p>There’s an insistently circular logic at play here: the hymn serves
as both the cause of the child’s death and means of his discovery,
instantiating one form of sacrifice and retroactively transforming it
into another. “The repeated return of the dead body” in “miracle of the
singing boy” stories that circulated widely in fourteenth century
England, Blurton and Johnson write, “mirrors the compulsion to repeat
the story.”<span class="citation" data-cites="blurton2017"><a
href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a></span> The metaphor of crying blood
that can’t be contained invoked by the Prioress, too, poses a notable
contrast with the Prioress’s own portrait in the <em>General
Prologue</em>, in which her prim table manners suggest an aversion to
spilling and waste. It’s in this respect that the Prioress’s
characterization may have as much of the maternal as the childish.
Readings of the poem have often emphasized its relationship to a
liturgical culture in which “adults were strongly encouraged to assume
the likeness of children and to submit to religious authority,”<span
class="citation" data-cites="salisburyChild pattersonwitnesses"><a
href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></span> but within the text, too, is
an economy of circulating blood and milk and “grains.” The insistent
return of the body, of the blood that won’t be silenced, excludes the
Jews from this insular economy by suggesting their inability to contain
– or properly consume – its circulating objects.</p>
<p>As Salisbury points out, in the burial of the clergion it’s the
“affective puissance of the child” that comes to the fore: “the child
makes the action happen, moves the adults to pay attention to the
child’s needs and remember what it was like to be a child. When one of
the precepts of this culture is for adults to become <em>like</em>
children, it signals the value of childhood by exposing the sacrificial
economy in which a child lives.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="salisburyChild"><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a></span> This
sacrificial economy is vividly illustrated with the initial call and
response between mother and child. Here, it isn’t the child who emits
the initial demanding cry, but the mother, and it’s the child’s voice
which returns the proof of love in the form of the hymn to the Mother.
Part of what’s so remarkable about this scene is that the tautological
economy in which God performs his own praise “by mouth of innocentz”
sutures the voice-object to the body of the child. Our perspective on
the agency of the child – and on the relation between it and the mother
– may begin to look quite different, then, when we shift our perspective
back from the altar to the shitter.</p>
<p>It’s on this point that the Marian register of the tale appears as
particularly entangled with its more explicitly violent ideological
commitments. The tale is animated by a network of female figures whose
desires with respect to a Child are explicitly identified with each
other (Mary, the little clergeon’s mother, and the Prioress herself).
It’s worth observing, too, that the relation between these maternal
figures and the child is one which is noticeably organized around an
absent father. That the clergeon’s mother is a widow and the Prioress
is, of course, unmarried are important points of identification with the
Virgin, figuring the child as a means for intimacy with a divine father
figure. In psychoanalytic terms, the child functions here as the
substitute for the mother’s <em>objet a</em> or symptom, never just a
child but itself the instrument by which the mother discovers what she
finds lacking in the father. The child, here, is at once, in a sense,
“objectified” in such a way that they must subordinate their own
individuality to the performance of this compensatory function, but is
also an obstacle to the mother’s self knowledge: the child-as-object, as
Lacan puts it, “alienates in himself all possible access by the mother
to her own truth through giving it body […].”<span class="citation"
data-cites="lacanChild"><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></span> Clinically
speaking, the situations in which this dynamic most often appears are of
course unambiguously abusive. A famous paper by Sándor Ferenczi, which
Lacan presumably had in mind when he wrote his “Note on the Child,”
reflects on the “dream of the wise baby” described to him by a patient,
in which “the fear of the uninhibited, almost mad adult changes the
child, so to speak, into a psychiatrist,” and, in so doing, must learn
to “<em>identify himself completely</em>” with the parents.<span
class="citation" data-cites="ferenczitongues"><a href="#fn60"

<p>I make note of this not in order to suggest (as psychonalaysis has
often done) that certain configurations of the family – ones organized
around single or homosexual parents, for instance – are somehow
“pathological” while others – heterosexual, Oedipal – somehow
<em>aren’t</em>. Rather, what’s striking about Marian ideology’s absent
father isn’t that the father function is foreclosed but that it’s
<em>exalted</em>: it collapses Father into Son in such a way that
sacrifices the particularity of any given father or son, subordinating
individuals to their function within the symbolic Family. Arguably,
then, the “pathologically” exceptional case of the “overbearing” desire
of the mother here speaks to the inherently abusive structure of the
family itself. It’s on this point which I would like to take a moment to
interrogate this rather fundamental problem in psychoanalysis, before
returning to a different Chaucerian scene in which a different modality
of desire and identification might begin to be traced.</p>
<h2 id="assuming-a-symptom">Assuming a symptom</h2>
<p>As I’ve touched upon in the introduction to this dissertation, the
psychoanalytic account of the family hinges on the way the Oedipus
complex scripts the melancholic assumption of a sex: the child assumes
their sex by way of their renunciation of the opposite-sex parent,
resulting, in post-Oedipal subjectivity, in the mutual exclusion of
desire and identification. While the Oedipal family is founded on this
melancholic structure, however, it’s in the pathology of depression
where there occurs a kind of short-circuiting of desire and
identification which may pose some problems to the integrity of this
structure. In order to understand some of the ways in which some of
these problems might begin to appear, though, it may be necessary to
begin from the pathological.</p>
<p>When Karl Abraham first wrote about melancholia, he had initially
understood it in terms of sexual frustration and disappointment: the
unconscious latches itself onto some person and doggedly refuses to let
go.<span class="citation" data-cites="abrahamselected"><a href="#fn61"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></span> With the 1917 essay
“Mourning and Melancholia,” though, Freud had begun to notice that the
problem of melancholia hinged on questions of identification: “In
mourning it is the world which has become poor and empty,” he observed,
“in melancholia it is the ego itself.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="SE14"><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></span> Here, melancholia already
appears as a pathology distinct from mourning specifically in the
melancholic’s identification with the lost object. This identification
is ridden with ambivalence: because their identification with their
loved object also includes its faults and injustices, the melancholic’s
investment in their object demands of them that they perform a kind of
balancing act between love and hate, directing violent aggression
towards their own ego all the more intensely for how much they love the
object they’ve unconsciously incorporated.</p>
<p>In 1923’s <em>The Ego and the Id</em>, Freud relegates this
ambivalent relationship between object-investment and identification to
a much earlier stage in the subject’s development than he had
previously. While for the young child in the oral stage,
“object-cathexes and identification are no doubt indistinguishable from
each other,” one consequence of the division he’s now begun to describe
between the id and the ego is that as the latter develops, the ego’s
identification with their loved object may become the
<em>precondition</em> for the id’s letting go of it. By the 1920s,
Freud’s topography of the human psyche is defined by division and
conflict: the dogged refusal to let go of the object is now identified
as the property of a specific agency that he identified as <em>das
Es</em> (latinized as the “id” in Strachey’s <em>Standard Edition</em>),
which “feels erotic trends as needs” and puts the still young and
“feeble” ego [<em>Ich</em>] in the position of having to choose between
acquiescing to the id’s demands or repressing them.<span
class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn63"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></span></p>
<p>While in Freud’s earlier metapsychological work in the teens the
melancholic’s identification with their lost object appeared as a
pathology that results from the inability or refusal to mourn an object
which has been lost, in Freud’s “mature” theory the melancholic mode of
surviving loss becomes much more fundamental to the establishment of the
subject’s character. The function of the developing ego is to take on
the role of substituting itself for the lost object in order to appease
the “id”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it happens that a person has to give up a sexual object, there
quite often ensues an alteration of his ego which can only be described
as as a setting up of the object inside the ego, as it occurs in
melancholia; the exact nature of this substitution is as yet unknown to
us. It may be that this introjection, which is a kind of regression to
the mechanism of the oral phase, the ego makes it easier for the object
to be given up or renders that process possible. It may be that this
identification is sole condition under which the id can give up its
objects. At any rate the process, especially in the early phases of
development, is a very frequent one, and it makes it possible to suppose
that the character of the ego is a precipitate of abandoned
object-cathexes and that it contains the history of those
object-choices.<span class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a
href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important shift has occurred between the Freud of the
metapsychological papers and now. The earlier account of melancholia is
more concerned with the discernment of melancholia’s <em>pathology</em>
as it distinguishes itself from grief and mourning. Now, however,
melancholia has become a much more foundational subjective structure. It
appears as a <em>precondition</em> for the development of the ego, and
one may well ask if in the process the ego itself has become an “object”
to which we find ourselves stubbornly and pathologically tethered.</p>
<p>What this shift also happens alongside is a more profound
Oedipalization of psychoanalysis. Freud notes that the outcome of the
Oedipal conflict – wherein the subject identifies with either the mother
or the father – is somewhat surprising given the melancholic theory of
subjectivity outlined above, as the assumption of a gender does not
apparently occur by way of “introduc[ing] the abandoned object into the
ego.”<span class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn65"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a></span> That an assumption of a sex
might happen <em>despite</em> the introduction of the abandoned object
into the ego is “easier to observe in girls than in boys,” as girls, by
Freud’s observation, will quite often respond to the relinquishing of
their father as a love object by identifying more strongly with the
masculine aspects of their own latent bisexuality. It’s in such scenes
where bisexuality, specifically from the vantage point of femininity,
once again becomes troublesome to Freud’s account of sexual difference,
since (as was the case with the passage between anal and genital
sexuality that I discussed in the previous chapter, or, that is, with
Silence’s assumption of a male sex) the assumption of the feminine
position here would appear to be somewhat arbitrary. This remains the
case even if the “bisexuality” Freud describes here is no longer the
object-indifferent polymorphous perversity of 1905’s <em>Three Essays on
the Theory of Sexuality</em> but is instead understood in terms of the
Oedipus complex’s narrative of the assumption of a gender on the back of
an object choice. In the case of the little girl, that narrative fails
to provide certain terms for how that assumption might take place, and
Freud ends up somewhat unsatisfactorily falling back on “bisexuality” as
what will ultimately determine the outcome of that narrative. How the
child occupies those terms and ultimately identifies as either a boy or
a girl is at the end of the day a question of “the relative strength” of
their “masculine and feminine sexual dispositions.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn66"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a></span></p>
<p>The extent to which those “dispositions” are themselves determined by
the Oedipus complex or somehow precede it is left unclear, but, as Freud
tells it, while the Oedipus complex provides the terms and narrative
structures for the assumption of a sex, it doesn’t from the outset
determine how the subject and their individual circumstances will find
themselves caught up within those terms. To use his own example, it’s
for instance entirely possible for a boy to simply pass through the
complex as if they were a (“heterosexual”) girl and vice versa. This
underdetermined quality even makes Freud question, for a moment, whether
the Oedipus complex is ultimately relevant at all in the determination
of a subject’s sex: “It may even be that the ambivalence displayed in
the relations to the parents should be attributed entirely to
bisexuality and that it is not, as I have represented above, developed
out of identification in consequence of rivalry.” Nevertheless, at least
“where neurotics are concerned,” it’s safe to assume its presence in the
subject’s history.<span class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a
href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a></span></p>
<p>It’s on the basis of this late formulation of Freud’s that Judith
Butler would later read Freudian theory as a theory of “melancholy
gender,” noting that Freud’s account provides an emergent account of
gender identification that presupposes the <em>preservation</em> of the
same gender which it disavows. On Butler’s reading, the masculine and
feminine positions of the “heterosexual matrix” supposed by Freud’s
account of sexual difference maps onto his account of melancholia
insofar as heterosexuality requires a repudiation of same-sex desire and
opposite-sex identification vis-à-vis a melancholic incorporation: “it
appears that the loss of homosexual objects and aims (not simply this
person of the same gender, but <em>any</em> person of that same gender)
will be foreclosed from the start.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="butlermelancholy"><a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref68" role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a></span> The ego now
appears as a graveyard of queer identifications, formed by and also
conserving its own disavowals.</p>
<p>However, since our disavowals are sustained by love, part of what
afflicts the melancholic is not only the lostness or inability to
identify their object but also their resistance to <em>mourning</em> it.
Perversely, there may be a sense in which one can be invested in
sustaining one’s own melancholia, often for reasons as simple as the
fact that we can’t bring ourselves to let go of our loved objects. To
mourn, in Freud’s terms, would mean to think one’s own splitness, to
undermine the certainty against which knowledge and identification are
measured: it would mean moving beyond the stultifying melancholia that
accompanies the subject being stuck on its lost objects by recognizing
and properly grieving those objects. That melancholia, too, begins to
provide the terms through which that recognition might begin to take
place, though, is a curious feature of Freud’s 1917 account of
depression. For Freud, melancholia also articulates a kind of
self-knowledge and awareness that would seem to only be able to come
into view <em>pathologically</em>.</p>
<p>While the melancholic excessively “reproaches” and “vilifies”
themself to the point of expecting “to be cast out and punished” by
those around them, it’s in the course of this barrage of self-debasement
that a kind of pathological clarity begins to emerge. Freud writes that
it would be “fruitless” to contradict a depressive patient in these
self-reproaches, for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He must sure be right in some way and be describing something that is
as it seems to him to be. Indeed, we must confirm some of his statements
without reservation. He really is as lacking in interest and as
incapable of love and achievement as he says. But that, as we know, is
secondary; it is the effect of the internal work which is consuming his
ego – work which is unknown to us but which is comparable to the work of
mourning. He also seems to us justified in certain other
self-accusations; it is merely that he has a keener eye for the truth
than other people who are not melancholic. When in his heightened
self-criticism he describes himself as petty, egoistic, dishonest,
lacking in independence, one whose sole aim has been to hide the
weaknesses of his nature, it may be, so far as we know, that he has come
pretty near to understanding himself; we only wonder why a man has to be
ill before he can be accessible to a truth of this kind.<span
class="citation" data-cites="SE14"><a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freud’s tone here is of course a little tongue-in-cheek, walking a
line between describing something about melancholic insight and
prescribing how a practicing analyst ought manage their own
counter-transferential response to a patient’s aggressive
self-deprecation in order to keep them talking. Crucially, the analyst
is to refrain from assuming themself to be in a place to assuage the
patient’s guilt, or to assume that the melancholic’s lost object is any
more accessible to the analyst than it is to the patient. Melancholic
insight, like psychoanalysis itself, “starts from pathology.”<a
href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> It’s in the course of following
through with the articulation of their own symptom that the melancholic
also, unconsciously, articulates a truth about themselves and the nature
of their desire. Such is the nature of the <em>symptom</em>: it sits at
the place of the desired object, obfuscating it even as it instructively
stages the subject reaching out towards it.</p>
<p>It’s important that the analyst not correct the patient here, too,
because part of the work of the analysis is to allow the patient to
begin to listen to themself as the analyst listens to them, and it’s in
this respect that melancholia occupies a unique place in Freudian
psychopathology because the melancholic has <em>introjected</em> their
object. For if the melancholic’s self-reproach is, in fact, a
misdirected criticism of a beloved object whose ambivalence the
melancholic hasn’t yet been able to come to terms with, the
working-through of that ambivalence with respect to the object might be
coterminous with working through an ambivalent relation with the self.
Such a position, it should be noted, is <em>foreclosed</em> by the
racist investments of the <em>Prioress’s Tale</em>. The Prioress’s
relation to her object is, in a sense, the opposite of that of the
melancholic: she identifies herself with her fetishistically idealized
“good” object in the Child and paranoiacally projects her own aggressive
impulses towards that object onto the phobically-caricatured “bad”
object of the Jews.</p>
<p>It may be the case that it’s in this foreclosure of the depressive
that there is also a foreclosure of the conditions by which the
pathological avoidance of ambivalence might be processed and overcome.
It’s in this inability to direct one’s critical gaze inwards, perhaps,
that phobia not only forecloses the reparative tempering of melancholic
self-criticism but also approaches the psychotic. This problematic is of
central importance to the work of Melanie Klein, for whom the
“depressive position” forms a kind of affective reference point that
functions as a kind of fulcrum of neurotic subjectivity insofar as it
continually provides the material for which the ambivalence of our
various attachments might be reckoned with.</p>
<h2 id="love-and-pacification">Love and pacification</h2>
<p>That Freud’s accounts of sexual difference and depression are,
relatedly, unfinished provides the starting point for understanding
Melanie Klein’s contributions to psychoanalytic theory. One of the more
striking features of Klein’s work is the way she centers the “depressive
position” in her account of neurotic subjectivity. On this, Klein’s
thought is generally divided into three periods. In her early work,
Klein takes an interest in the young child’s process of integrating
their internal images of the parents into a mature superego. Following
this period is the discovery of the “depressive position,” and, with it,
the investigation into the ways in which, following the early
integration of “good” and “bad” objects, the splitting of such objects
becomes progressively more aligned with reality as the child learns to
reconcile themself with the ambivalence of their attachments. In her
later work, Klein’s work with adult schizophrenics has brought her
attention to the integration of the <em>ego</em> and the ways in which
“[i]ntegration depends on love impulses predominating over destructive
impulses.”<span class="citation" data-cites="kleindict"><a href="#fn71"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a></span> This interest in the
reparative capacity of love is something which emerges very early in her
career. In 1930’s “The Importance of Symbol-Formation in the Development
of the Ego,”<span class="citation" data-cites="LGR"><a href="#fn72"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a></span> for instance, Klein observes
that the schizophrenic child’s “flat affect” can be attributed to an
overly strong superego, and that the child’s guilt and suppression of
his own destructive impulses correlates with an inability to form happy
attachments. The corollary to Klein’s observation of early childhood in
terms of anxiety, fear, and splitting is that the trajectory of
childhood development is towards love: “the child shows an ever-growing,
deeply rooted desire to be loved and to love, and to be at peace with
the world about it.”<span class="citation" data-cites="LGR"><a
href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></span></p>
<p>In her 1963 paper “On the Sense of Loneliness,” her last, Klein’s
primary concern is the question of “integration.” For Klein, integration
is the central “<em>developmental task</em>” for the subject, but this
doesn’t mean that she thinks that there is any sense in which a subject
is ever fully “cured” or that the split nature of subjectivity simply
passes away.<span class="citation" data-cites="kleindict"><a
href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></span> That some of the more
understated and quotidian affects like loneliness speak to both to the
ever-postponed terminability and <em>necessity</em> of “integration” is
what makes them of such importance to both Klein’s theoretical and
clinical work. As she observes in the essay on loneliness,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Full and permanent integration is never possible for some polarity
between the life and death instincts always persists and remains the
deepest source of conflict. Since full integration is never achieved,
complete understanding and acceptance of one’s own emotions, phantasies
and anxieties is not possible and this continues as an important factor
in loneliness.<span class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn75"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loneliness testifies to its own unrequitedness, representing a
longing for a state of non-contradiction in which difference doesn’t
impossibilize reciprocity between our inner and outer worlds. Its
longing is all the crueler for its resemblance to nostalgia, as its
glance looks back beyond the conservative stasis sought by the drive and
into an originating fantasy of wholeness that we know we ought to know
better than to believe in. The “inner sense of being alone regardless of
external circumstances, of feeling lonely even when among friends or
receiving love” – is ultimately a “yearning for an understanding without
words,” that is, “for the earliest relation with the mother.” Klein
calls it “ubiquitous.”<span class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a
href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a></span> Loneliness marks a
disjunction between feeling and unconscious knowledge, testifying to the
way our fantasies imprint themselves on our day-to-day reality despite
ourselves.</p>
<p>I think it’s this sensitivity to affect that makes Klein’s at times
crudely allegorical and apparently dualistic interest in the life and
death “instincts” a bit deceptive. While loneliness testifies to a
melancholic foundation that grounds the subject’s ego in a kind of
nostalgic longing, this longing isn’t made out to be foolish on account
of its unrequitedness – there’s a sense in which it’s
<em>necessary</em>, since it also enables the capacity for love and
enjoyment. Love in this sense isn’t simply the victory of one instinct
over another but the ongoing work that must accompany the rediscovery
and reparation of the subject’s desire. It’s this “nostalgia” and
longing for the mother’s breast that enables “enjoyment” in the first
place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A happy relation to the first object and a successful internalization
of it means that love can be given and received. As a result the infant
can experience enjoyment not only at times of feeding but also in
response to the mother’s presence and affection. […] Moreover, there is
a close link between enjoyment and the feeling of understanding and
being understood. At the moment of enjoyment anxiety is assuaged and the
closeness to the mother and trust in her are uppermost. […] Enjoyment is
always bound up with gratitude; if this gratitude is deeply felt it
includes the wish to return goodness received and thus the basis of
generosity.<span class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn77"

</blockquote>
<p>It’s on this point that Klein moves beyond Freud’s accounts of
projection and melancholia – which privilege the projection or
introjection of the destructive impulses of the “death instinct” – to
the insistence that, at the same time, there exists the “urge of the
life instinct to find a good object in the external world.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a></span> As in Freud,
this finding is always really a <em>refinding</em>, and the fact that
desire is structured by a melancholic relation to its loved object means
that the melancholic subject can discover within themselves the means to
mourn and repair their own attachments through love.</p>
<p>Klein’s understanding of mourning and melancholia may be read
dialectically insofar as love functions as the means for overcoming the
dualism of the “instincts.” As it does for the philosopher Gillian Rose,
love for Klein provides a kind of “third” or “middle” term insofar as it
“arises out of misrecognition of desire, of work, of my and of your
self-relation mediated by the self-relation of the other.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="roseMourning"><a href="#fn79"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a></span> It’s a “work” that is
independent of its object, but which is also made meaningful in relation
to that object. It’s in this sense that the Kleinian object begins to
resemble something like Hegel’s sense of the modern <em>law</em> (by
Rose’s account, at least), insofar as the “urge toward integration” that
is propelled by love supposes that this “integration” is coterminous
with a “full mutual recognition” that is both <em>necessary</em> and
only able to “be approached phenomenologically, […] by expounding its
dualistic reductions.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="roseMourning"><a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></span> Something of
this can be seen in Klein’s understanding of the ego. There are times in
Klein when the ego appears as something that one only catches glimpses
of within the flux of introjection and projection. Klein’s ego appears
only as movement, never able to be spoken of in terms of a discrete,
self-present “object.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the ego remains something whose “integration” Klein is
keenly invested in. The securing of a “good object” in childhood serves
as a lifelong counterweight to the death-driven parts of subjectivity in
the libidinal balancing act of integration. Crucially, when the subject
projects and introjects “goodness” and “badness” of the world, these
processes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>are not <em>predominantly</em> related to fragmented parts of the
personality but to more coherent parts of the self. This implies that
the ego is not exposed to a fatal weakening by dispersal and for this
reason is more capable of repeatedly undoing splitting and achieving
integration and synthesis in its relation to objects.<span
class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “object” isn’t “external” to the ego, and the “ego” is, in a
sense, an object that the subject continually falls towards and away
from in a “comedy” of misrecognition through which it is propelled by
desire. Importantly, though, the ego <em>survives</em> its
misrecognitions: within the flux of introjected and projected objects,
as it moves through the world it manages to find a center of gravity,
however precarious. As is the case for Rose, the Kleinian subject isn’t
simply doomed to their misrecognitions and caught forever in projected
delusions. It <em>is</em>, in fact, ultimately able to form some sort
rapport with the Real. The tenor of this process is <em>comic</em> in
the Hegelian sense, insofar as part of what the approach towards
integration entails is the development of an awareness of the fact that
in reality the things which we take as our objects are in fact, often,
also other <em>subjects</em> – they, too, are “split”
self-relations.<span class="citation" data-cites="roseMourning"><a
href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For Eve Sedgwick, one of the advantages of Klein’s account of early
childhood as opposed to Freud’s and Lacan’s is the way it reframes
“omnipotence.” “In Freud’s view,” she writes, “we want as much power as
we can get and indeed start out with the assumption that we are
omnipotent; everything after that is a big, disillusioning letdown
called reality.”<span class="citation" data-cites="sedgwickKlein"><a
href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></span> For Klein, though,
“omnipotence is a fear at least as much as it is a wish”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Kleinian infant experiences a greed – her own – whose aggressive
and envious component is perceived as posing a mortal threat both to her
loved and needed objects and to herself. Thus the perception of oneself
as omnipotent is hardly less frightening than the perception of one’s
parent as being so. <br />
  In fact, this all-or-nothing understanding of agency is toxic enough
that it is a relief and a relaxation for the child eventually to
discover a different reality. The sense that power is a form of
relationality that deals in, for example, negotiations (including
win-win negotiations), the exchange of affect, and other small
differentials, the middle ranges of agency – the notion that you can be
relatively empowered or disempowered without annihilating someone else
or being annihilated, or even castrating or being castrated – is a great
mitigation of that endogenous anxiety, although it is also a fragile
achievement that requires discovering over and over.<span
class="citation" data-cites="sedgwickKlein"><a href="#fn84"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Klein’s narrative by which children experience object relations from
an extremely early moment in life provides, for Sedgwick, a useful
inversion of Freud’s phallocentric narrative of the Oedipal stage. For
Freud, though, the fact that the Oedipal phase happens prior to a final
“genital” stage means that along with this sense of “omnipotence” he
locates in early childhood that the sexual instincts are objectless. As
Alenka Zupančič puts it, they are “not innate, not object-based, and not
procreative.”<span class="citation" data-cites="zupancicSex"><a
href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></span> Rather than being
necessarily scripted by an a priori sense of something like “biological
sex,” the Oedipal narrative is primarily a way of allegorizing the way a
child <em>assumes</em> a sex. It introduces a sense of differentiation
to what was prior a polymorphous, undifferentiating sexual drive.</p>
<p>One would be justified in asking, then, what sorts of new attachments
and desires are made available and foreclosed when Klein argues for the
presence of object relations in early childhood. In a sense, the
“relief” with which the child discovers the limits to their own
omnipotence is rather importantly also a relief at assuming a normative
sexuality. By arguing that Oedipal object relations are present for the
infant before they can cohere into a narrative in which the child comes
to terms with castration, Klein <em>psychically locates a melancholic
structure of sexual difference prior to the development of the ego</em>.
The outcome of this line of thought is an even more rigidly “binary”
account of bisexuality than can be found in Freud at his most Oedipal. A
dream of one of Klein’s patients serves as an instructive example. In
the dream, a little girl holds out a hoop for a lioness to jump through,
only to be killed because on the other side of it lies a precipice. As
this game plays out, a little boy off to the side kills a snake. Klein
reads the lioness as herself and the little girl as the patient’s
“feminine part,” noting that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was extremely painful to the patient to become aware that, being
in competition with my femininity, he wanted to destroy me, and in the
past, his mother. The recognition that one part of himself wanted to
kill the loved lioness-analyst, which would thus deprive him of his good
object, led to a feeling not only of misery and guilt but also of
loneliness in the transference. It was also very distressing for him to
recognize that the competition with his father led him to destroy the
father’s potency and penis, represented by the snake.<span
class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing that’s very striking about Klein’s reading of such a dream
is that even if it assumes an account of latent bisexuality, there also,
exists, for Klein an unproblematized, coherent sense of sexual
difference that she locates in the unconscious. Every object in the
dream is saturated with Oedipal signification, taking for granted, then,
that each one is <em>gendered</em>. If the violence towards the
snake/phallus appears somewhat as an afterthought in this account, it’s
because for Klein the more fundamental problem is that the patient,
being male, hasn’t found it within himself to properly mourn “his
difficulty over the feminine position,” and the unbearable fact that he
unconsciously wishes to destroy his own “feminine part.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a></span> Here,
reparation comes on the back of a recognition whose function is to
pacify the unruly and pathologically non-normative identifications that
constitute sexuation, as the recognition of this “feminine part” serves
only to foreground the patient’s more stable assumption of the masculine
position. The unconscious has been fully Oedipalized, reduced to a
collection of readily interpretable signifiers whose allegorical
referents can be found in a narrative which has been quietly pushed
towards being a condition of the “normal.”</p>
<p>Like Freud, Klein assumes the mutual exclusion of longing for and
identifying with one’s object; part of what the theory of reparation
attests to is the existence of integrative instinct in the subject that
counters the death drive. Reparation, then, is a facet of mourning: it
names the process by which we recognize the lost object in order to come
to terms with its lostness, that is, to identify the object so that we
may dis-identify <em>with</em> it. Part of what attention to the
centrality of sexual difference in Klein’s theory of reparation brings
into view is the sense in which reparation necessarily involves
foreclosure and letting go, and the unmoored, ambiguous, and
underdetermined qualities of the depressive position suggest their own
undoing and working-through. Reparation, in other words, speaks to the
violence of recognition whose function is to pacify not only the death
drive itself but the identifications which are understood to be haunting
the subject and standing in the way of their flourishing. While often
necessary, this violence shouldn’t be passed over, as it also speaks to
the ways in which the reparative “urge towards integration” can find
expression in much graver forms.</p>
<h2 id="al-is-yliche-good-the-book-of-the-duchess">“Al is yliche good”:
<em>The Book of the Duchess</em></h2>
<p>The prologue to <em>The Book of the Duchess</em> establishes the text
as a series of hermeneutic events mediated by a melancholic body.
Chaucer’s account of melancholia is a closed economy, in which the
subject’s affect is imprinted by their bodily state, which in turn is a
condition of “thoght”: the dreamer can’t sleep because he suffers from
“so many an ydel thoght”, which he suffers from because he can’t
sleep.<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a
href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a></span> What this dialectic produces
is a sense of false equilibrium, an affected flatness:</p>
<blockquote>

Joye or sorowe, whereso hyt be –<br />
For I have felynge in nothyng<br />
But as yt were a mased thyng,<br />

id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gravitational pull of melancholic thought levels the mind with
the body, entangling one with the other. Depression here is a state of
discomfiting equilibrium, in which for the “mased” (bewildered, dazed)
subject “all is equally good.” It’s striking that a psychological state
characterized in terms of its affective stagnation should be
characterized as a perversion of the dialectical tension between thought
and embodiment, and that the affective leveling that results in the
perception of all things as “equally <em>good</em>” should be associated
with morbidity. Melancholia’s stagnation, perhaps, is somewhat restless.
This may be why there may be something <em>unnatural</em> about
melancholia insofar as the melancholic subject treads the line between
living and dying: “For nature wolde nat suffyse / to noon erthly
creature / nat longe tyme to endure / withoute slep and be in
sorwe.”<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a

<p>It’s from this psychic reference point that we’re brought into
<em>Book’s</em> first nested text, a re-telling of the story of Ceyx and
Alcyone from book eleven Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> in which the
shape-shifting god Morpheus takes on the form of King Ceyx in order to
deliver the news of the king’s death to his wife. Perhaps it’s the
grogginess of the reader that rushes the story along and fudges some of
the details of the story. Whereas in previous versions of the story
Morpheus is portrayed as a shape-shifting, flying god, a master of
imitating the human form (<em>non illo quisquam sollertius alter
exprimit incessus vultumque sonumque loquendi</em> – “no other is more
skilled than he in representing the gait, the features, and the speech
of man”),<span class="citation" data-cites="ovidMetamorphoses"><a
href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a></span> here Juno has him go
physically fetch Ceyx’s corpse from the bottom of the ocean so that he
might crawl into it: “byd hym that, on alle thyng, / He take up Seys
body the kyng, / That lyeth ful pale and nothyng rody. / Bid hym crepe
into the body / and do hit goon to Alcione.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a></span> In the
<em>Metamorphoses</em> the tragedy of the tale comes in part from the
foretelling of the king’s death – Alcione dreams Ceyx’s fate before his
voyage and he fails to heed her warnings. In Chaucer’s retelling details
like this fall out or are glossed over. Alcione’s initial swoon comes
not from the chilling foresight of the dream and subsequent worrying of
its coming true but from her uncertainty about the length of her
husband’s absence, and instead of praying to Juno for his safety, she
asks for a dream, “Wherethrough I may knowen even / Whether my lord be
quyk or ded.”<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a
href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Julie Orlemanski has argued that Chaucer’s use of poetic form in
<em>The Book of the Duchess</em> is “unprecedentedly materialist,
requiring the scarce and singular matter of the dead,”<span
class="citation" data-cites="orlemanskiheaviness"><a href="#fn94"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a></span> and one may well ask how
much this is colored by the melancholic dreamer’s depressive position.
As Orlemanski emphasizes, for Chaucer prosopopoeia has a
<em>weight</em>; rather than attempting to distinguish form from
materiality it awkwardly imposes itself and weighs down upon language.
This weight is felt as well in the wandering attention span of the
nested reading itself. In Ovid, Morpheus appears to Alcyone when she is
in a dream state, as an <em>image</em>. Donning his form and imitating
his voice and gestures, Morpheus-as-Ceyx informs Alcyone’s of his death
so she can mourn him properly. The plan is complicated by its own
effectiveness, however: groaning, in a dream state, Alcyone implores
Morpheus to stay, and in so doing wakes herself up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Awakened by the sound of her own voice<br />
and by her husband’s image [<em>specie</em>], she attempts<br />
to verify if it was really him<br />
whom she has just observed; roused by her cries,<br />
the servants had brought in a lamp, and she,<br />
unable to find him anywhere,<br />
began to strike herself about the face,<br />
and tearing at the robes upon her breast,<br />
struck it as well, and without bothering<br />
to let her hair down, started tearing it.<br />
  And answered, when they asked what caused her grief,<br />
“Alcyone is no one any more:<br />
she died with Ceyx! No consolation please!”<span class="citation"
data-cites="martinMetamorphoses"><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ovid’s text the distinction between the worlds of gods and humans
remains intact: the voice responds to an image, but it’s the former
which wakes the body. Alcyone, inconsolable, doesn’t perform funeral
rites but instead goes to cast herself off a cliff, transforms into a
bird, and flies to her husband’s corpse to give him a final kiss,
prompting the gods to show mercy and transform them both: “as birds, /
their love and conjugal vows remain in force: / they mate and rear their
young; for seven days, / <em>halcyon days</em>, in winter.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="martinMetamorphoses"><a href="#fn96"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This note of chipper reproductive futurism is dramatically cut off in
Chaucer’s abbreviated and cheekily morbid retelling. Chaucer’s
materialism here is to be found not so much in its refusal of
metaphysics as in how it ignores the distinction between form and
materiality. Rather than performing a convincing rendition of a rotting
corpse, Morpheus literally drags the corpse to the foot of her bed in
order to deliver the news,<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></span> upon the
reception of which Alcyone swoons and dies within three days for reasons
the narrator apparently just doesn’t care to relate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With that hir eyen up she casteth<br />
And saw noght. “Allas!” quod she for sorwe,<br />
And deyede within the thridde morwe.<br />
But what she sayede more in that swow,<br />
I may not telle yow as now;<br />
Hyt were to longe for to dwelle.<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did Alcyone see nothing because the corpse was a vision, or because
it was simply dark in her bedchamber? What happens during the three-day
swoon between “Allas!” and the instant of her death? These details fall
by the wayside, because the story, apparently, is rather effective at
getting the narrator to sleep. The narrator is primarily struck by the
notion of a god of sleep – “I had never herd speke or tho / Of noo
goddes that koude make / Men to slepe, ne for to wake, / For I ne knew
never god but oon”<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a></span> – and it’s by
fantasizing about Morpheus and resolving to ask him to help him sleep
that the narrator eventually, finally, dozes off.</p>
<p>Even here, the materialism of <em>The Book of the Duchess</em> comes
into view not only in the texture of the language itself – Chaucer’s
overdetermined use of the Germanic word <em>crepen</em>, for instance,
to reimagine the “airy shape-shifter” Morpheus “as a lowly physicalized
thing”<span class="citation" data-cites="orlemanskiheaviness"><a
href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a></span> – but as well in a poetics
that insistently points outside of itself, as if to indicate its own
boundedness so as to surpass it. This is of course what happens with the
climax of the dream itself that follows, in the way the Man in Black’s
definitive acknowledgment of his lover’s death coincides with the waking
of the dreamer such that the poem manages to scrupulously avoid
representing the afterlife. This, too, is related in terms of the
dreamer’s gullible, heavy-handed reading skills, when the Man in Black,
incredulous that the dreamer hasn’t surmised this already, finally
bluntly acknowledges that the lover he’s been talking about for the bulk
of the vision is indeed dead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bethenke how I seyde here-beforn,<br />
‘Thow wosst ful lytel what thow menest;<br />
I have lost more than thow wenest.’<br />
God wot, allas! Ryght that was she!”<br />
  “Allas sir, how? What may that be?”<br />
  “She ys ded!” “Nay!” “Yis, be my trouthe!”<span class="citation"

<p>“Death itself cannot sustain poetry,” D. Vance Smith observes here,
as it is both death’s immanence and deferral that sustains it.<span
class="citation" data-cites="smithdying"><a href="#fn102"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a></span> The poem’s sense of
materiality, then, lies not only in the way it gives form the heaviness
of the corporeal form, but also in the way the poem’s <em>memento
mori</em> comes into view in the poem’s interruption of itself, that is,
in the re-severing of language from the body. The conversation between
the dreamer and the Man in Black is cut short by the horn indicating the
end of the hunt, and the dreamer, in turn, is woken up by the striking
of the twelve o’clock bell from a nearby tower.<span class="citation"
data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref103" role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a></span> This bell
“announces the intrusion of a regime of memory that depends upon
repetition rather than forgetting,” Smith writes, “but, more important,
it suggests a regime that is able to contemplate historical death
directly and somehow translate it into meaning.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="smithdying"><a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref104" role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a></span></p>
<p>It does seem important, however, that the text is sustained by these
little flawed repetitions and imperfect identifications. While the
ontological status of what wakes Alcyone is left ambiguous, the
dreamer’s awakening by the bell might well be a winking acknowledgment
of Chaucer’s source. That Chaucer’s retelling of Ceyx and Alcyone skips
over the quaint heterosexuality of the lover’s metamorphoses into
kingfishers in favor of slimy reanimated corpses and sudden death also
anticipates the queerness of the dream that follows, which L.O. Aranye
Fradenburg has read as a “series of survivals,” in which “the hetero
couple gives way to friendship” between the dreamer and the Man in Black
and “relations of reproduction and substitution give way to
replication.”<span class="citation" data-cites="fradenburgSacrifice"><a
href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"

the Man in Black in mid-swoon, an erotics emerges in the man’s
passionate description of his deceased lover and, in turn, in the
dreamer’s apparently naïve inability to catch on to the fact that the
lover has died. It’s this same naïvete, though, that keeps the man
talking. Fradenburg argues that within this play of polite deferrals and
affected ignorance,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>courtly love has been displaced by courtier love, which stylizes the
court through the vigilant and equalizing mannering of the group body
always aware of and anticipating its own destructivity […]. The mannered
body and voice equalizes, but does not dissolve, rank; it deflects, but
registers, danger. Rank permits special gifts of friendship, because a
great man risks a little prestige when he condescends to courtly
friendship with a lesser man, and a lesser man risks what rank he has by
approaching a greater man. Courtesy is an economy of sacrifice as well
as prosthesis, a mannering and extension of sentience that elaborates
the form of <em>the</em> group, so that no one goes alone and the
endlessly deferred other always goes first […].<span class="citation"
data-cites="fradenburgSacrifice"><a href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref"

</blockquote>
<p>It’s within this series of repetitions and deferrals that there is
any “meaning” to be found in death, as this cautious disclosure of
attachments produces, for Fradenburg, a “zone of exacerbated
sensibility” in which the Man in Black “is thrown toward death, and made
to share the exemplary status of his lost object” when he declares a
total identification with his own sorrow (“For y am sorwe, and sorwe ys
y.”)<span class="citation"
data-cites="fradenburgSacrifice riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn107"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"

of downward movements across the <em>Book</em> – whether in the Man in

data-cites="orlemanskiheaviness"><a href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref109" role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a></span> that leads us
to the subterranean sliminess of Morpheus crawling into the waterlogged
body of the dead king, or, finally, which might be traced along the
<em>Book’s</em> catalogue of swoons.</p>
<p>Chaucer’s version of the story also has a kind of jarring presentism:
in Ovid’s original text, part of what registers as tragic is the fact
that Ceyx’s death <em>is</em> foretold – by Alcione, who begs him not to
set off on his voyage. Chaucer cuts this part out: Alcione’s deathly
swoon becomes formally reflected by the dreamer’s being lulled into
sleep and <em>out</em> of the living death of melancholic insomnia (“I
had be dolven everydel / And ded, ryght thurgh defaute of slep”).<span
class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn110"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a></span> What’s at stake here isn’t
a question of life and afterlife so much as life’s
<em>extensibility</em>: Chaucer’s nesting of narratives is such that one
life falls into another, and the reader falls into the reverie which
makes up the main body of the <em>Book</em> with the same downward
motion as that of Alcione’s swoon. The pull of narrative here is
gravitational rather than sequential, drawing inward rather than towards
something. This movement also nudges us towards an understanding of
identification as something that isn’t necessarily about a homology of
being so much as a chain of provocative links – in the Lacanian idiom,
“little objects” or occasions of desire – along which we are pulled.</p>
<p>It’s in this sense that what Fradenburg refers to as an “exacerbated
sensibility” names what’s queer about the poem, recalling Leo Bersani’s
writing in various places on “impersonal narcissism”, that form of
self-love that emerges on the back of the “extensibility of sameness,”
and for which “the self out there is ‘mine’ without belonging to
me.”<span class="citation" data-cites="bersanirectum"><a href="#fn111"

the shape of falling <em>into</em> something: Alcyone’s swoon into her
death becomes repeated in the reader’s reception of the text, muffling
the details as he himself falls into slumber. The Man in Black, too,
exhibits all the same melancholic symptoms as Geoffrey himself: in
between life and death but not necessarily dying, he observes, “Hit was

role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a></span> the description and
listing-off of the Man in Black’s <em>symptoms</em> draws us – Geoffrey
– closer towards him, until we find ourselves standing at his feet.</p>
<p>The way Geoffrey is drawn towards the Man in Black is communicated
through a series of small recognitions. This is identification in the
<em>analogical</em> sense, as Freud describes it in <em>Group Psychology
and the Analysis of the Ego</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One ego has perceived a significant analogy with another upon one
point – in our upon openness to a similar emotion; an identification is
thereupon constructed on this point, and, under the influence of the
pathogenic situation, is displaced on to the symptom which the one ego
has produced. The identification by means of the symptom has thus become
the mark of a point of coincidence between the two egos which has to be
kept repressed.<span class="citation" data-cites="freudgroup"><a
href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question which the above account emerges out of for Freud is an
important one: can there be identification with the loved object where
the object is retained? Is it possible to be <em>and</em> to have one’s
object of affection? For Freud the answer is yes, though it depends on
repression: “What is inconceivable in the Freudian scheme,” Bersani
writes in “Socialibility and Cruising,” is “<em>identification as
libidinal recognition</em>.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="bersanirectum"><a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a></span> The
exception, of course, lies with the “perversion” of homosexuality: even
in the classic Freudian account of the Oedipus complex, Freud’s
hypothetical homosexual (man) essentially bypasses the conflict with the
father vis-à-vis “an identification that is neither a loss nor
object-love in the usual sense.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="bersanirectum"><a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a></span> For Bersani,
if the upswing of heterosexuality’s inability “to think of desire other
than as lack or loss” is a “nonmurderous wonder at difference,”<span
class="citation" data-cites="bersanirectum"><a href="#fn119"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></span> then homosexuality offers a
way of thinking sociality in which the sense of a priori castration,
rather than being either narrativized into a story of fallenness (as is
the case in neurotic heterosexuality) or denied (as in psychosis), might
be seen as the basis for a kind of sexual <em>sociability</em>, in which
there may be a <em>pleasure</em> to be discerned in “being less than
what we really are”<span class="citation" data-cites="bersanirectum"><a
href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a></span> in the company of others.
The homosexual, in Bersani’s telling, “wanders in the world – cruises
the world, we might almost say – in search of objects that will give him
back to himself as a loved and cared for subject.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="bersanirectum"><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a></span></p>
<p>While the play of “courtier love,” as Fradenburg calls it, of course
very much does depend on the repression of identification as libidinal
recognition in the <em>Book</em>, there is also a sense in which
Chaucer’s dreamer resembles Bersani’s cruising homosexual, in that what
links together the series of disparate scenes that comprise <em>The Book
of the Duchess</em> are these little recognitions, identifications, and
imperfect replications, sexual or otherwise. There may be, in other
words, a kind of solidarity of being to be found in the symptom. We find
this in the “I”: when the Man in Black laments “y am sorwe, and sorwe ys
y”<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a href="#fn122"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a></span> the “I” is, on the one
hand, “pure symptom” insofar as it “correspond[s] with pure
suffering,”<span class="citation" data-cites="fradenburgSacrifice"><a
href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a></span> but, grammatically, there’s
a sense in which the “I” is always already less than what it really is.
A.C. Spearing has pointed to the importance of <em>deixis</em> in what
he’s called medieval “autographical” texts like dream visions and the
Old French <em>dit</em>, arguing that “the change to fictional speakers
as the norm occurred,” exceptional cases like <em>The Canterbury
Tales</em> notwithstanding, “long after the Middle Ages.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="spearingautographies"><a href="#fn124"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a></span> There may be an important
sense in which the “I” in a text like the <em>Book</em> functions
linguistically as a pure “shifter”: “the first-person singular pronoun
need not be referential (referring consistently to an individual who
uses the word”I”); it may only be deictic, its function being to convey
proximality and experientiality without specific refence to a pragmatic
center or <em>origo</em>.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="spearingautographies"><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a></span></p>
<p>While Spearing’s articulation of the deictic function of the “I” is
insistent upon the way it loosens the “purely” grammatical function of
pronouns from historical or sexed referents,<span class="citation"
data-cites="spearingautographies"><a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a></span> in the
<em>Book</em> the grammatical unmooredness of the “I” is itself weighed
down, contaminated, drawn in towards and outside of itself: rather than
“pure shifter” it’s an <em>analogy</em>. In her history of photography,
Kaja Silverman distinguishes the analogical quality of the photograph
from previous understandings of it in terms of its indexicality or
capacity for representation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…analogy is also the fluid in which it develops. This process does
not begin when we decide that it should, or end when we command it to.
Photography develops, rather, <em>with us</em>, and <em>in response to
us</em>. It assumes historically legible forms, and when we divest them
from their saving power, generally by imputing them to ourselves, it
goes elsewhere.<span class="citation" data-cites="silvermananalogy"><a
href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analogy, in this sense, is to be distinguished from the sense in
which photography either indexes or represents, instead speaking to the
way in which “Two is the smallest unit of Being.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="silvermananalogy"><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a></span> When I
identify with an object, I don’t simply act upon it or mold myself to
it; I involve myself with it. If the “I” is “pure symptom,” then, there
may be a sense in which it’s necessary to account for the ways in which
its purely grammatical indexicality is contaminated, if not fixed or
determined, by the ways analogy involves it in its objects and points to
the similarities that “give everything the same ontological weight” in
the world without collapsing difference.<span class="citation"
data-cites="silvermananalogy"><a href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref129" role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a></span></p>
<p>It’s interesting, then, that Chaucer begins with the melancholic
symptom, framing the poem as one related by an unreliable, morbidly
sleep deprived,<span class="citation" data-cites="riversidechaucer"><a
href="#fn130" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a></span> “mased” reader. Returning
to this moment now, the “I” appears to me not as an indexical container
in which I might put myself but as a symptom amongst other symptoms, no
more or less important in involving me with this affective state – in
which “al is ylyche good” – than the symptoms of sleeplessness or
“amazement.” This is what I would suggest is “materialist” in Chaucer’s
poetic sensibility. Not only does Chaucer undermine some distinction
between form and matter, but it takes <em>discourse itself</em> as the
“matter” of poetry. Its subject doesn’t exist prior to the material in
which it recognizes and constitutes itself.<a href="#fn131"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a>
There’s also something to medieval representation of melancholia itself
that brings this into view, however, in the kind of leveling or
unhinging that occurs when the object of desire is a somewhat open
question.</p>
<p>“Depression,” Lauren Berlant notes, is an ambivalent pathology, and
has a way of “producing the prisonhouse or the lightness of not caring;
or the freedom or vertigo from detaching and seeing multiple horizons;
or the excited scanning or dark melancholy that might saturate
everywhere when desire no longer has an object to give living on a
discrete shape.”<span class="citation" data-cites="berlantintend"><a
href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a></span> As I discussed in the
previous chapter with Boethius’s <em>Consolation of Philosophy</em>, in
the medieval moral imaginary melancholia demands a supplement. The
flailing for “an object to give living on a discrete shape,” in other
words, may itself may be productive of something, or at least may
provide the language by which that object might come into view. Part of
what the <em>Book</em> helps bring into view, then, is that if
depression speaks to an involvement in the world, it’s in part because
it’s when we’re depressed that this object is in question but also
<em>posed</em> as a question, and in so doing might itself provide a
means of a kind of subjective integrity.</p>

Edelman’s capitalization of “Child” follows Lacanian idiom to suggest
that he specifically refers to the “Symbolic” Child, rather than any

sexuality is based on the discovery that sexuality confronts us with a
number of unsolvable problems and conflicts that are rooted in our
biological constitution and that are at the basis of psychopathology.
But this biological constitution can only be studied properly
<em>starting from</em> pathology. The primacy of sexuality and the
primacy of the pathological for the understanding of human existence are
thus for Freud two sides of the same coin.”<a href="#fnref70"

unconscious in “Psychoanalysis and the Aesthetic Subject”: “there is no
specified unconscious prior to the material from the external world in
which it at once recognizes and constitutes itself. The unconscious
never is; it is perhaps an essentially unthinkable, intrinsically
unrealizable reserve of human being – a dimension of virtuality rather
than of psychic depth – from which we connect to the world, not as
subject to object, but as a continuation of a specific syntax of being”
