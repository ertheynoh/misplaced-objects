    <h1>interminable complaint</h1>
    <h2>(on hoccleve)</h2>
      <p>Complaint, as Lauren Berlant expressed it in <em>The Female
      Complaint</em>, is a genre characterized by ambivalent attachments. It
      speaks to both the disappointment resulting from “the failure of
      relation” and the survival of “some fidelity to the world of distinction
      and desire that produced such disappointment in the first place.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="berlantComplaint"><a href="#fn1"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> It’s a “genre,” but also a
      mode – of investment, of backhanded attachment, and of enjoyment. In
      Jewish humor, complaining – <em>kvetching</em> – “can be applied
      indifferently to hunger or satiety:”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="wexkvetch"><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> the <em>kvetcher</em> takes a
      special pleasure in complaining about complaining; about having
      complained; about others who complain. The Yiddish word <em>kvetch</em>
      is derived from the Middle High German <em>quetschen</em>, meaning to
      crush, bruise, or squeeze;<span class="citation"
      data-cites="OEDkvetch"><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span> but Michael Wex makes sure to
      highlight the anality of the Jewish translation of the word into its
      rich culture of complaint:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>It isn’t simply to strain, but “to strain,” as Harkavy has it, “at
      stool,” to have trouble doing what, if you’d eaten your prunes the way
      you were supposed to, you wouldn’t have any trouble with at all. […] A
      really good kvetch has a visceral quality, a sense that the kvetcher
      won’t be completely comfortable, completely satisfied, until it’s all
      come out.<span class="citation" data-cites="wexkvetch"><a href="#fn4"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The true <em>kvetcher</em>, though, is never completely comfortable.
      They withhold their own satisfaction, remaining within the scene of
      complaint. The complaint of the habitual <em>kvetch</em>, then, has an
      object, but it isn’t necessarily the one that occasions her kvetching at
      a given moment. To complain is to attend to the fact that there’s
      something lacking in the real, which is to say that it touches the real
      through the presupposition of a fantasy. Complaint is itself a mode of
      “negotiating belonging to a world,”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="berlantComplaint"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> even it proceeds
      from a dogged attachment to what’s lacking in it. Complaint is a
      symptomatic discourse; it always has an object whose inexistence it both
      marks out and is occasioned by; it demands a supplement, which often
      must be created by way of what it occasions in the first place.</p>
      <p>Thomas Hoccleve is one of Middle English poetry’s most prolific
      kvetches. In the <em>Compleynte paramont</em>, his translation of a
      Marian lament from Guillaume de Deguileville’s <em>Le Pèlerinage de
      l’Âme</em>, grief tips over into the realm of complaint when the
      subject’s loss of a beloved object is world shattering, and brings into
      view a sense of loss that precedes the loss of the object in question.
      Narrated from the perspective of the Virgin Mary, the <em>Compleynte
      paramont</em> is cried from a place of utter despair. At least within
      what’s preserved in the passage selected by Hoccleve for translation,
      absent is the temporal logic of <a href="boethius.html">Boethian</a>
      fortune. The speaker’s “ioye hath made a permutacioun” – an exchange –
      “With wepyng and eek lamentacioun,”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span> and within the moment of
      agony the poem articulates, the anticipation of that joy returning is
      circumscribed:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>O Gaubriel, whan þat thou come aplace<br />
      And madest vnto me thi salewyng<br />
      And seidist thus, “Heil Mary, ful of grace,”<br />
      Whi ne had thu gove me warnyng<br />
      Of þat grace that veyn is and faylyng,<br />
      As thu now seest, and sey it weel beforne?<span class="citation"
      data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The shattering effects of loss reverberate in all directions,
      resignifying what precedes it. It reveals grace to be “vain,” and divine
      hailing to have proceeded from the deceptive withholding of knowledge.
      This is the site that complaint takes as its founding point of
      reference, however contingently: contemptuously looking upwards from the
      nadir of existence.</p>
      <p>It’s this positioning of the subject of complaint that is of interest
      to me here. The Marian complaint here begins with grief over
      <em>difference</em> – specifically, that between mother and son, and
      figures Christ as an ambivalent object of attachment. “It seemeth þat
      thow makist departynge / Twixt thee and me for ay withoute endynge,” she
      laments, making special note of the impersonal way in which he addresses
      her: “And namely syn thow me ‘womman’ callist, / As I to thee straunge
      wer and vnknowe. / Therthurgh, my sone, thow my ioie appallist.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn8"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span> More than grieving the loss
      of a son what she laments is his <em>separation</em> from her. Who
      enacts that separation? The Father or the Son? It’s this entanglement of
      <em>taking</em> and <em>losing</em> that renders the Christ into an
      unbearably ambivalent object in this scene, as the loved object becomes,
      too, the agent responsible for the destruction of her joy.</p>
      <p>The ambivalence I’m trying to emphasize in this passage can perhaps
      be clarified by way of a reminder of iterability of the father function
      in Freudian psychoanalysis. Within a certain trajectory of Lacanian
      readings of Freud, there is a particular emphasis on impersonality of
      the Father as a <em>function</em>. As Willy Apollon articulates it in
      his rereading of the Freudian Oedipal scene, this renders the family
      itself into a “problematic” in which “<em>the father</em> or the
      function of the father comes <em>to articulate a limit, to install the
      time of a loss.</em> He renders possible an object for desire, as long
      as this object is lost, inaccessible, or impossible. The <em>father</em>
      is then a <em>separator</em> […].”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="apollonpsychoses carlson2010"><a href="#fn9"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></span> Or, as Lucie Cantin writes,
      “The father has no raison d’être other than to represent the law of the
      symbolic,” and the performance of his function is somewhat portable:
      “The father is thus whoever is named as ‘father.’ He is <em>not</em> the
      father, strictly speaking, merely because he may have impregnated the
      female.”<span class="citation" data-cites="afterlacan"><a href="#fn10"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span> What the Marian scene
      re-enacts is the particular violence of this function when its falls
      upon the child to perform it. The child, here, is the mother’s
      <em>symptom</em>: he “gives her, in immediately accessible form, what
      the masculine subject lacks: the very object of his existence appearing
      in the real.”<span class="citation" data-cites="lacanChild"><a
      href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span> Insofar as the child is the
      mother’s symptom, his function is, in a sense, to occupy the space left
      empty by her lost object. In the scene of Marian complaint, this dynamic
      can be traced in her total identification with her symptom by way of a
      process which exceeds the limits of life itself.<a href="#fn12"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
      <p>Hoccleve’s translation of the lyric is marked by a particular
      sensitivity to and emphasis on this moment of identification, in which
      grief has moved from world-shattering resignification, to the
      confrontation with the ambivalence of the loved object, and, finally, to
      a shattering of the self. As I've touched upon <a
      href="prioress.html">before</a>,
      one facet of Marian fantasy is a collapse of difference with the loved
      object. Here, this is articulated in the jouissance of the destruction
      of the <em>I</em>: “Wel may men clepe and calle me Mara / From
      hennesforward, so may men me call. / How sholde I lenger clept be Maria,
      / Syn ‘I’, which is Ihesus, is fro me fall.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></span> The play on spelling – and
      on the courtly language of “sweetness and gall” (“Mara” being itself a
      name derived from the Latin <em>amare</em>, bitterness) – slips into the
      grammatical a few stanzas later, when Mary’s suffering provocatively
      risks tipping over into the experience of Christ’s death as her own:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>For now the taast I feele and the streynynge<br />
      Of deeth. By thy deeth feele I deeth me stynge.<br />
      O poore modir, what shalt thow now seye?<br />
      Poore Marie, thy wit is aweye.<br />
       <br />
      Marie? Nay, but ‘marred’ I thee calle.<br />
      Vessel of care and wo and sorwes alle.<br />
      Now thow art frosty cold, now fyry hoot,<br />
      And right as þat a ship or barge or boot<br />

      So doost thow, woful womman, confortlees.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Hoccleve’s rendering of the poem into rhyme royal in English is in
      part responsible for the devastating line break which results in the
      triple repetition of the word “deeth” on line 215. In the lines which
      follow – and for the remainder of the poem – the “I” is displaced, as
      the second person addressee is no longer God/Christ but Mary herself.
      Not only does her “wit” wander away, with her maternal function having
      been exhausted so too does her motherly “style”. “And of modir haast
      thow eek lost the style,” this new ghostly “I” entones, “No more maist
      thow clept be by thy name.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></span> What’s striking about the
      function of complaint here is that it doesn’t appear to foreclose
      redemption, but it does locate the speaker prior to its arrival, in a
      moment when it is circumscribed and only present as a potentiality which
      has yet to make its imprint on the complaining utterance itself. In the
      <em>Compleynte paramont</em>, there’s no mention of “redemption” until
      the final line of the poem.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>Though firmly positioned in the negative, the complaint marks the
      space of what it lacks: the object to which it’s attached is preserved
      insofar as it structures its entire discourse even in its inexistence.
      The complainer is compelled to speak by and through the loved object
      which she’s lost but continues to create space and speech
      for nonetheless. In the <em>Compleynte paramont</em>, before it brings
      the poetic death of the speaker, the loss of the “I” occasions an
      overflowing of speech: “Of sorwe talke may I nat ynow,” the Virgin
      complains, “Syn fro my name ‘I’ doon away is now.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></span> While complaint is a
      symptomatic discourse, its structure – that is, the shape or trajectory
      of the desire its narrative belies – isn’t determined by its symptom so
      much as it is articulated through it. While the “original” and famously
      autobiographical poems Hoccleve is now better remembered for articulate
      structurally distinct desires and narrative trajectories than the
      <em>Compleynte paramont’s</em> Marian mode, these later works do share
      an interest in symptomatic discourse, particularly in the way that
      the complaint begins in negativity and self-difference.</p>
      <p>The articulation of self-difference – of the representation of the
      dysphoria that results from feeling other to oneself that recurs so
      frequently in Hoccleve’s writing – is also of course importantly sexed
      here. This is perhaps a banal observation to make about a Marian lament
      lyric, but is nevertheless striking in light of Hoccleve’s more personal
      work. The figure of a wandering “wit” so famously associated with <em>My
      Complaint</em> (more on this later) of course makes its appearance here,
      but in a distinct overflowing of jouissance, in which the speaker is
      eliminated by and alongside her object, “wit” and “style” spilling out
      along with the “I.” This, of course, proceeds from an unbearable
      recognition of sexual difference: in the strangeness of being called
      “woman” by her own son (“As I to thee straunge wer and vnknowe”),<span
      class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn18"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></span> and in the severance so
      harsh that the entire experience of having been a mother takes on a new
      darker hue. Another, earlier, moment in which Mary apparently addresses
      herself in the second person is when she addresses the former self who
      had carried and nursed Christ:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>O womman þat among the peple speek,<br />
      How þat the wombe blessid was þat beer,<br />
      And the tetes þat yaf to sowken eek<br />
      The sone of God, which on hy hangith heer,<br />
      What seist thow now, why comest thow no neer?<span class="citation"
      data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Especially contrasted with her current state, the passage is
      remarkable for its emphasis on the sensuality of motherhood. In
      <em>Mothers</em>, Jacqueline Rose muses on the ways in which the
      idealization of motherhood obscurs the centrality of pleasure and pain
      to it, recalling a quip of Jean Laplanche’s regarding the absence in art
      and psychoanalytic writing of representations of breastfeeding. “I have
      known mothers who stopped breastfeeding,” she notes, “simply because
      they felt they were liking it too much.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="roseMothers"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></span> In another
      moment in the <em>Compleynte</em>, the speaker reminisces on all the
      moments in which her child snuggled up in her arms, or sat upon her
      knee, with kissing slipping into sucking: “Thow sat and haddist many a
      kus of me. / Eek thee to sowke on my brestes yaf Y, / Thee norisshyng
      fair and tendrely.”<span class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a
      href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></span> This provocatively erotic
      representation of breastfeeding may offer a nice counter-example to
      Laplanche’s comment, and hardly less so for the unrecoverability of the
      enjoyment they speak to, in part because it’s the world-shattering loss of
      the object that brings into view the extent to which that world was
      structured by the object’s presence in the first place.</p>
      <p>Despite the poem’s overtly melancholic register, too, and despite the
      way in which this jouissance comes into view when the speaker is forced
      to confront herself as an <em>other</em>, the poem doesn’t begin and end
      with a melancholic theory of <a
      href="https://misplaced-objects.neocities.org/posts/22-02/gender_melancholic_structure.html"
      target="_null">gender</a>. The speaker isn’t <em>less</em>
      feminized, for instance, for her present condition, in which she finds
      herself “barren” of joy<span class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a
      href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></span> and with a “woful
      wombe.”<span class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn23"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span> Rather, something like a
      “feminine jouissance” is found in the poem not in the signifiers of
      femaleness or femininity – or, for that matter, their lack – as much as
      it appears as something immanent in the complaint itself, which weaves
      together the extremes of pleasure and pain into a discursive whole that
      paradoxically constitutes the subject in the very process of its
      unraveling. It’s from this register that the jouissance of the text
      proceeds: in the literal coming-apart of language on the level of the
      letter, in these silent shifts in grammatical subject/object, and in
      this unarticulatable distance between motherhood at its most serene and
      most abject. It’s this non-communicative excess of language from which
      this “other jouissance” arises that Lacan referred to as
      <em>lalangue</em>, and which language, short of being able to represent,
      certainly speaks to it and strives to know it: “Language is what we try
      to know concerning the functioning of llanguage
      [<em>lalangue</em>].”<span class="citation" data-cites="lacansem20"><a
      href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>Compare this with Hoccleve’s <em>La Male Regle</em>, which begins with
      a
      description of the speaker’s unwellness. “And now my body empty is, and
      bare / Of ioie and ful of seekly heuynesse,” Hoccleve laments, in lines
      striking if for no other reason than for their recollection of the
      <em>Compleynte paramont</em>’s language of emptiness and heaviness.<span
      class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn25"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></span> In <em>La Male Regle</em>
      the speaker is also looking back on a former self from the perspective
      of a miserable present, though the tone is comical and mock-penitential.
      The first part of the poem consists in this disclosure of sin which
      begins, as it does for many, in the speaker’s youth. This youthfulness
      appears, for a moment, in prosopopoeial form, and the speaker’s “unwary
      youth” is referred to with feminine pronouns: “Myn vnwar yowth kneew nat
      what it wroghte,” he writes, “whan fro thee twynned shee. / But of hir
      ignorance hirself shee soghte, / And kneew nat þat shee dwellyng was
      with thee.”<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a
      href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></span> The feminine pronouns drop,
      however, when the invocation of “youth” moves to more general
      proclamation that “for the more paart, youthe is rebel / Vnto
      reson.”<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn27"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></span> The moment stands out if
      only because <em>La Male Regle</em> is not a poem that is otherwise
      especially interested in allegory. Though the poem is addressed to
      “helthe,” the word only comes up three times in the poem,<span
      class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn28"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></span> and the concerns of the
      speaker wander substantially with respect to the question of his own
      health.</p>
      <p>In fact, this passing reference to the speaker’s own youth in this
      way is an example one of the poem’s many diversions in the unfolding of
      its speaker’s symptomatic discourse. While the insistance of “another
      jouissance” can be traced in the gap between the maternal pleasure the
      <em>Compleynte paramont</em>’s speaker enjoys in her youth and the
      abjection of her narrative present, in <em>La Male Regle</em> the
      attempt to draw a contrast between the speaker’s past self and present
      immediately falls flat and is forgotten. This is because in the
      temporality of the poem’s symptomatic discourse, this “unwary youth” is
      very much part of the speaker’s narrative present in his writing of an
      <em>ongoing</em> ailment. The “letter” of the speaker’s symptom – the
      signifier, that is, around which it is organized – lies elsewhere,
      providing the <em>Male Regle</em>’s speaker with a fundamentally
      different relationship to his own enjoyment than what is seen in the
      Deguileville translation. Far from staging the speaker’s identification
      with his symptom, what’s notable about <em>La Male Regle</em> is that it
      self-consciously presents itself as a “writing of jouissance” with and
      against the signifier with which its symptom is embroiled. The poem’s
      discourse, in other words, is symptomatic insofar as the poem speaks
      itself as its own symptom.</p>
      <p>After broadly condemning youthful rebellion against reason, the first
      section of the main body of the poem mainly consists in the recounting
      of the speaker’s various wrongdoings. The speaker’s principal sins are
      gluttony and drunkenness, sins which are from the start tied to money.
      The speaker notes that he’d been inclined to drink as often as he
      could,<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn29"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"

      out of money to spend on alcohol:</p>

      <p>Money functions as the signifier around which the speakers symptom
      takes shape: it functions to limit the enjoyment of the narrator’s
      “greedy mowth,”<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a

      simply never stop shoving things in it. By providing his illness with a
      limit, however, money also grants it a shape and a temporality: it marks
      its pathology as something other than something characteristic of the
      subject’s “nature” or as a passing illness by granting it a rhythm. It
      makes the symptom <em>repeatable</em> and imbues it with a rhythm,
      providing a scene to which the subject is compelled to return to over
      and over again. Money structures his pathological tendency towards
      “excess,” but it also provides the rhetorical conceit around which the
      poem’s tongue-in-cheek irony turns when its affected penitential tone is
      revealed to have been a complaint all along.</p>
      <p>It’s on this point that the subject’s relationship with himself “as
      an other” is already radically distinct from that of the speaker in the
      <em>Compleynte paramont.</em> In the latter, the movement of the
      speaker’s lament is carried along by a desire to overcome the difference
      between the subject and its object, even if this requires the shattering
      or death of the subject. Marian devotion is <em>erotic</em>: its desire
      is to transform two into one.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="lacansem20"><a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></span> For the speaker
      of the <em>La Male Regle</em>, however, the object itself induces a
      split: if one will excuse the terminology, money partakes in a wholly
      “phallic” symbolic economy, insofar as it functions at the place of the
      phallus as limit to enjoyment while at the same time providing the terms
      on which the subject is able to enjoy at all. This is a “masculine”
      structure, insofar as the terms of enjoyment are incomplete without this
      limit, and insofar as the object “keeps the symbolic moving in the same
      circuitous paths, in constant <em>avoidance</em> of the real.”<a
      href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Whereas Marian jouissance proceeds
      indifferent to the limits of language and life itself, in <em>La Male
      Regle</em> “thought itself is jouissance-laden,”<span class="citation"

      id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></span> as the pleasure
      of the text is folded back on itself by way of its layers of
      self-deprecating irony.</p>
      <p>One of these layers appears in the way Hoccleve represents his own
      masculinity in this section. While there seems to have been no shortage
      of beautiful women passing through among the taverngoers at his regular
      haunts,<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn35"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></span> he recalls that he never
      slept with any of them, and that, given the opportunity to, he would
      have been perfectly content with just a kiss: “Of loues aart yit touchid
      I no deel. / I cowde nat, and eek it was no neede, / Had I a kus, I was
      content ful weel, / Bettre than I wolde hand be with the deede. /
      Thereon can I but smal, it is no dreede.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></span> And despite the
      rambunctiousness of tavern culture and his reputation as a regular
      amongst it, he insists upon the consistency of his “manly cowardyse”
      preventing him from ever slandering anyone – at least, that is, “on
      highte” – lest it come to blows.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></span> It’s the
      <em>anticipation</em> of inadequacy that informs Hoccleve’s timidity in
      these scenes. Here, the risk of an encounter – whether sexual or
      combative – is something the subject flirts with but doesn’t go all the
      way through with; never bold enough to risk his actual emasculation
      moving beyond the level of a threat. Such is the assumption of “manly
      cowardice”: not that one doesn’t “have it” (that is, the “phallus”) but
      precisely the opposite, insofar as what the manly coward fears most is
      having “it” taken away.</p>
      <p>It’s with exactly this kind of backhandedness that Hoccleve
      establishes something like an authoritative poetic voice throughout the
      poem. The next major part of the poem consists of an extended rant
      against flatterers. The digression is prompted by the recollection of a
      time when he’s headed home drunk and decides, lazily, to pay for a boat
      ride back. “Other than maistir callid was I nevere,” he observes, noting
      that the politeness never failed to prompt him to tip well: “So tikelid
      me þat nyce reuerence / Þat it me made larger of despense.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn38"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></span> It’s a clever moment of
      tongue-in-cheek self-deprecation, as the purpose of this doubling down
      on his own sloth and gluttony ultimately provides the material for a
      diversion. What follows is a lengthy digression as the speaker laments
      the ways in which the worst “combreworldes” – world-encumberers – of all
      are flatterers and “enchantours,”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></span> and how “Men

      speaker’s own history of gluttony and sloth, one may suppose, it may at
      least be observed that he’s honest.</p>
      <p>The poem of course begins as a confession, and upon ending the
      digression with a pithy final condemnation of “excess,”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn41"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></span> the speaker begins to
      loquaciously, and perhaps even with a hint of fondness, reflect upon his
      history with it once more:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>No force of al this. Go we now to wacche<br />
      By nytirtale out of al mesure,<br />
      For, as in þat, fynde kowde I no macche<br />
      In al the Priuee Seel with me to endure,<br />
      And to the cuppe ay took I heede and cure,<br />
      For þat the drynke apall sholde noght,<br />

      data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>“Go we now” to watch the night all the way through: this invitation
      in the present tense to stay up all night prompts in Hoccleve the memory
      of many nights spent drinking himself to sleep. One assumes, though,
      that with this “go we now,” Hoccleve isn’t sitting and pouring himself
      another drink but coming to terms with the consequences of his actions.
      The temporality of “go we now” is ambiguous. Even as the recounting of
      historical drunkenness implies the sins that the speaker recounts to
      belong in the past, the “now” in which the reminiscence is prompted
      speaks to an ongoing condition as the speaker grasps for more footholds
      to fill in the space left by lack of drink with words.</p>
      <p>It’s a motivating conceit of the poem that the sickness suffered by
      the speak is one “<em>As wel</em> of purs as body,”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn43"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></span> and it’s the ongoing
      sickness of Hoccleve’s <em>purse</em> which remains the emphasis for the
      remainder of the poem. As he embarks on another digression about the
      importance of moderation in spending one’s coin, he catches himself
      rambling: “Ey, what is me, þat to myself thus longe / Clappid haue I? I
      trowe þat I raue. / A, nay, my poore purs and peynes stronge / Han artid
      me speke as I spoken haue.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></span> What’s
      remarkable about Hoccleve’s use of digressions is precisely the way he
      frames them as empty speech; truly, they are <em>diversions</em> from
      the actual object of the poem – and the poem does very much
      <em>want</em> something. Hoccleve’s digressions are clearly defensive:
      what the digression on “enchanters,” for instance, would seem to want to
      imply is that for all the speaker’s “excess,” it at least may be said
      that he is honest, and that despite the “sickness” of his purse that he
      really, in fact, does have a genuinely good command of just price theory
      and abstinence. Given how Hoccleve himself has described his illness as
      a <em>compulsion</em>, one may well ask whether this moment of
      impoverishment is simply the prelude to another drunken binge, as it’s
      this “sickness of purse and body” that physically and financially
      prevents him from continuing more than anything else.</p>
      <p>But this perfectly logical deduction would perhaps itself be the
      outcome of another backhandedly ironizing gesture. What Hoccleve finally
      leaves us with is not a petition to “Helthe,” but to his patron, who he
      now addresses in order to ask for his £10 annuity and to remind him that
      he still owes the speaker payment for previous years.<span
      class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn45"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></span> It’s on this latter detail
      that the ending of the poem slips from confession to complaint: “I dar
      nat speke a word of ferne yeer, / So is my spirit symple and sore
      agast.”<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn46"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></span> While what the poem demands
      is the payment of an owed wage, what the rhetorical shift suggests is
      that the speaker’s “sickness of purse” may not entirely be the result of
      his own bad habits, but may at least in part result from a history of
      neglect on the part of his patron. It’s here where the poem shifts to
      complaint, insofar as the thing that its speaker lacks speaks to a
      history of that lack which precedes the narrative present of the poem
      itself, a present in which the condition produced by this history of
      lacking is very much ongoing. It’s exactly in this turn to complaint,
      though, that Hoccleve does something quite radical: he makes a
      <em>demand</em>, and he <em>names</em> the Other from which the poem
      makes that demand by addressing the poem to Lord Fourneval.<span
      class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn47"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>Insofar as the poem is written in order to petition for the payment
      of a wage, there is a sense in which money is in itself the poem’s
      symptom, as it would appear to be the thing the speaker most
      wants. Because the speaker lacks that object, this lack occasions the
      poem itself and colors its scenes. It’s this distance from the object
      that preserves it, however: unlike in the case of the <em>Compleynte
      paramont</em>, there’s no sense in which the speaker <em>identifies</em>
      with his object, except insofar as he remains attached to the scene
      which it symptomatically structures. Rather than appearing as a
      world-shattering event, the loss of the object is ordinary, and is even
      in a sense pleasurable, at least to the extent that it produces a scene
      that he keeps returning to. It’s the anticipation of this loss happening
      again (and again) which emplots the use he makes of the object in the
      first place.</p>
      <p>In that sense, at least until a certain point in the poem, money
      would appear to be the speaker’s symptom: we can trace the speaker’s
      illness along its path, and see that insofar as it occupies the space
      left by his <em>objet a</em> it also obfuscates it by locking him into a
      self-destructive cycle of false need and false desires. Hence the
      fleetingness of Hoccleve’s metaphors and digressions: the feminine,
      prosopopoeial “youth” dissipates as quickly as she is summoned because
      what she is invoked to give form to is in fact also embodied by the
      speaker himself in speaking her into being. The poem symptomatizes
      itself for its object; its speaker speaks himself as a scene which is
      made intelligible by its object’s lack. And of course it does: as the
      poem nears the end and shifts to the register of complaint it confesses
      itself to have not been a confession in the first place and
      retroactively provides the terms of its own fictionality. This is of
      course a conceit: the poem wryly reveals the speaker’s self-deprecating
      persona <em>as a persona</em> in an ironic twist that itself serves as
      the passive aggressive set-up to ask its audience for payment in a sense
      not altogether dissimilar to the plaint about spendthrifts that begins
      <em>Le Roman de Silence</em>, or any number of troubador lyrics.</p>
      <p>I would suggest that there’s also something deflating in the way
      Hoccleve levels the demand at the end of the poem. By addressing his
      specific patron by name, and by writing in an autobiographical 
      mode, Hoccleve calls attention to the symptomatic
      function of money in his own poem. No longer does the poem appear to be
      addressed to God or “helthe,” but more specifically to a certain Lord
      Fournival; and the rehearsal of the subject’s gluttonous repetition
      compulsion whose cycles are determined by the phallic signifier of money
      take on a new character when the complaint shifts its mode of address
      from its own self-demeaning and ill speaker to a <em>failing on the part
      of the Other</em> who his discourse is revealed to have been addressing
      all along.</p>
      <p>In psychoanalytic terms, what the writing of signifier of money
      <em>as a signifier</em> here does, then, is to help shift our attention
      away from the scene of the signifier – whose jouissance is centered on
      the subject’s castration – and brings to its attention the <em>Other’s
      castration</em>. “It is important to note,” Apollon writes, “that the
      <em>symptom</em> has more to do with <em>the failure of the
      signifier</em> than with the loss that signifies the subject’s
      castration. It’s the <em>jouissance at stake in the symptom</em> that
      relates more radically to the <em>Other’s castration</em>, in that the
      Other’s castration is the mode in which the failing of language is
      verified.”<span class="citation" data-cites="afterlacan"><a href="#fn48"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></span> What’s most remarkable about
      <em>La Male Regle</em> lies in the fact that this ironic turn by which
      confession transforms into complaint casts the authority of this
      signifier into doubt, shifting the site of the speaker’s enjoyment from
      the repetition of the signfier’s scene to the writing of the symptom
      itself.</p>

      never in fact identical with the “object,” but acts, in a sense, as its
      placeholder. Even if this means that it obscures this “true” object, the
      <em>form itself</em> of the symptom articulates the insistence of a
      desire that exceeds it. It’s in this excess that an enjoyment beyond
      satisfaction – an “other jouissance” that comes from outside the symptom
      itself – can be said to insist in the subject’s attachment to their
      symptom: “I love you, but, because inexplicably I love in you something
      more than you – the <em>objet petit a</em> – I mutilate you” (<span

      107. I put “masculine” and “feminine” in scare quotes to emphasize that
      Lacanian psychoanalysis ultimately distinguishes between these positions
      in terms of the subject’s relation to jouissance rather than in response
      to questions of gender socialization or identification – at least
      insofar as the latter is articulated in what Lacanians term the
      Imaginary. As <span class="citation" data-cites="carlson2010">Carlson,
      <span>“In Defense of Queer Kinships”</span></span> convincingly argues,
      however, Lacanians’ preservation of Freud’s normatively gendered terms
      even in their de-essentializing re-reading of them may be worth moving
      away from in order to better emphasize the ways in which Lacan
      understood these roles as <em>functions</em> that aren’t reducible to
      either gender identity or biological determination. It should also be
      noted, of course, that both the poems in question here are written by
      men: if there’s a sense in which the situating of the appearance of this
      “other jouissance” in the Marian lyric is “feminine,” it’s in a sense
      brought into view by a phallic structure and reference point which it
      exceeds and takes as its foil. Rather than somehow undermining the value
      of this jouissance, though, I think this only strengthens the case for
      the more formalist approach of theorists like Apollon and Carlson, in
      which the emphasis on <em>functions</em> and relations can potentially
      be more flexible to cultural and imaginary situations in which
      often-overdetermined terms like “masculine” and “feminine” may muddle
      more than they clarify.<a href="#fnref33" class="footnote-back"
