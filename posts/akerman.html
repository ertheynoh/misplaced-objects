<h1>how to listen</h1>
<p>Recently I rewatched Chantal Akerman’s 1974 film <em>Je, tu, il,
elle</em> at a cinema with some friends. Every time I see it with others
I find myself in the position of having to explain to someone why I love
this film – and Akerman – as much as I do. So I’d like to try and take
some notes on that.</p>
<p>What I find nourishing in Chantal Akerman’s cinema is that her films
don’t take listening for granted. It’s very difficult to listen in the
sense that Akerman’s films teach. I say “teach” because I do think
what’s interesting about these films is how they <em>address</em> you as
a listener. They put you in a position where you must listen, and I
think people often find this experience uncomfortable. Akerman’s films
ask you to listen without judgment, from a place of ambivalent – yet
engaged – attention.</p>
<p>There are two things that interest me with respect to <em>Je, tu, il,
elle</em>: the position of receptiveness that the film asks me to occupy
<em>as a listener</em>, and also that the film <em>addresses</em> and,
moreover, addresses <em>me</em>, in the first place.</p>
<p>In the first part of the film we are alone with “Julie” in her small
one-room apartment while she writes a letter to a now-ex lover. “I was
very clear in what I said,” she narrates. “First it took me three pages
to express myself. Then I wrote the same thing in six pages.” Light
slowly comes into the room as these lines are spoken, with the murky
figure of Julie gradually coming into view as she writes through the
night.</p>
<p>Sitting by the window, she continues to write the following day, all
the while spooning sugar into her mouth. After a certain point, the
spooning becomes compulsive and overtakes the writing act itself. “I
wrote eight pages while eating a lot of sugar. Then I crossed things
out. And corrected things. A few lines remained.” In writing there is
resistance to language. As I write this, I have a tab open in my text
editor for scrapped paragraphs and phrases.</p>
<p>The effect of having the night pass through the unlit room, in one
static shot, over the course of about fifty seconds surely resembles the
subjective compression of time that occurs when one is working intently
on something throughout the night. All I can really say about this is
that it’s real. You will know this if you’ve ever spent multiple days in
succession writing, sleeplessly, a letter to a lost lover.</p>
<p>The first part of <em>Je, tu, il, elle</em>, then, attends to the
neurotic struggle to find words to <em>express</em> something. In doing
so, it also attends to resistance – to the silences which accompany each
of those words. As the scene continues, Julie spends more time eating
sugar than writing.</p>
<p>I’ve referred <a
href="diss/chaucer.html#al-is-yliche-good-the-book-of-the-duchess">before</a>
to a tradition within medieval literary criticism of reading the
<em>I</em> of certain texts in terms of its “purely ‘grammatical’
function,” freed from the burdensome weight of history or sex. I wonder
if in a text like <em>Je, tu, il, elle</em> if there is some troubling
of this fantasy of the <em>I</em>’s deictic function. A sense in which
<em>Je</em> remains a kind of placeholder, but one which retains some
residue of positional specificity.</p>
<p>There is something of this in what Teresa de Lauretis seems to be
after in an old essay of hers called “Rethinking Women’s Cinema.” There,
she discusses the ways in which Akerman’s 1975 film <em>Jeanne
Dielman</em> “<em>addresses its spectator as a woman</em>, regardless of
the gender of the viewers.” The film achieves this, she says, by
defining “all points of identification (with character, image, camera)
as female, feminine, or feminist.” De Lauretis emphasizes that such a
cinema ought to be characterized by its ambivalent positionality. To
“<em>address the spectator as female</em>” is posed in contradistinction
to questions of representation, to the portrayal of women “positively or
negatively.”<span class="citation" data-cites="deLauretis87"><a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p>I think there’s something real there, too. I encountered that essay
not too long after I’d first been exposed to Akerman’s films, and there
was something uncanny about the way de Lauretis’s words seemed to speak
to something I’d felt watching <em>Je, tu, il, elle</em> for the first
time. I think at the time I described it (very awkwardly) in terms of a
certain feeling of openness, or of floating. This was before I’d found
the resources and courage to transition, physiologically anyway.
Watching <em>Je, tu, il, elle</em> felt like being unhinged from myself
in a way that no work of art had ever quite done to me. It was, I think,
because of how the film <em>addressed</em> me. It did so by generously
offering its <em>Je</em> as a point of reference.</p>

alt="Julie (played by Akerman), smiling, shirt on. &#39;I stripped and looked at myself.&#39;" /></p>
<p>In the second part of the film, Julie leaves her apartment and
hitches a ride with a truck driver. They eat at a restaurant in silence,
watching an American cop show on a television out of frame. They drive
more. They stop at a bar. They drive more. Julie sleeps on and off in
the bed behind the driver’s seat, admiring the truck driver’s broad neck
and red hair. “I thought I wanted to kiss him.” He wakes her to get up
at another stop and she smiles at his touch. They get out of the truck
and embrace in the night’s darkness before going to another tavern where
they smoke a cigarette and drink a beer, exchanging glances and little
smiles. They return to the truck, and now the driver takes her hand and
places it on his crotch.</p>
<p>We haven’t, until this point, actually seen Julie or the driver
exchange a single word. Now he speaks, no longer making eye contact.
“You see this is what matters.” We watch his face in the dark truck
cabin as she strokes his cock off-camera, with him giving instructions
and little updates on his progress each step of the way. “You obey but
you’re afraid.” After he comes he rests his head on the steering wheel
for a second, accidentally honking the horn when he gets up. Now he
looks at her – and in the darkness of the truck cabin it looks as though
he might be looking directly into the camera – and smiles.</p>
<p>There’s a cut. Julie returns into the frame, but only partially, in
the foreground. For the first couple of frames her face is barely
discernible in the darkness, her presence marked by the white zipper of
her jacket. The shaky movement of the truck getting back onto the road
brings her face, in profile, from the eyebrows down, back into view, but
the focus remains on the man. He lights a cigarette (as one must). “I
met my wife out in the country.”</p>
<p>He recounts meeting his wife on the side of the road when he was lost
and looking for directions, and how they’d had sex for the first time
right then and there. Eventually she becomes pregnant, and he has to get
another job. Now they only screw on the weekends. “It’s strange. It’s as
if the kid stopped us from screwing.” Sex becomes a “marital duty,” like
“bringing home the bacon, or bouncing the kid on my knees.” He talks
about picking up girls on the road, having sex with them in the back of
the truck. Julie reflects the slightly sheepish admission with the
suggestion of a smile.</p>
<p>Julie doesn’t speak to the driver at all during this part of the
film. She communicates with her gaze, which never leaves him.
Occasionally, she smiles, as if to provide him the permission necessary
to continue speaking. The smile comes again when he talks about watching
his wife changing his son’s diapers, observing that he already gets
erections. In contrast to the little boy, he comes home too tired to
have sex. “I must be getting old.” The smile comes again when talks
about his daughter. “She’s quite a dish, small as she is, and just
eleven.”</p>
<p>The first time I watched this film, I watched it with a man. When we
were discussing the film while leaving the theatre he talked about how
difficult it was to sit through this scene, how disgusted he was by this
truck driver. It made him feel, as I recall, embarrassed by his own
maleness. I was surprised by this reaction, I think, because what I’d
been so struck by in this scene was its lack of judgment. I’d also, of
course, had my share of passing sexual encounters with men and didn’t
find anything particularly shocking about this one. It just felt
real.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that nothing about the scene required the viewer to
identify with this man, or to sympathize with what he was saying.
Neither does it ask, however, that the viewer pass judgment on him. The
film doesn’t really ask your opinion. It just makes you listen to him.
Which is what I did. I took note of his gestures, his smiles.
Occasionally, like Julie, I even allowed these smiles to show up on my
own face. Sometimes it makes me laugh.</p>
<p>I think noticing the difference between our two responses was an
important moment for me. If <em>Je, tu, il, elle</em> is a film that
addresses its viewer “as female,” then, for me, this felt quite natural.
Actually, it felt <em>nice</em>, in a way that had much less to do with
the content of the film than how it addressed me. I hadn’t yet started
referring to myself “as female” at that point but I think of my first
time watching <em>Je, tu, il, elle</em> as a moment when that began to
feel like something that could become possible. That the film addressed
me the way it did without checking my gender at the door meant that its
address could become a kind of invitation. For my friend, though, maybe
it had felt more like a splitting, genuinely dysphoric. Perhaps he’d
understood the man’s perspective all too well.</p>
<p>“The less you understand,” Jacques Lacan quips in an early seminar,
“the better you listen.”<span class="citation" data-cites="lacansem2"><a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> Lacan was, of course,
addressing a room of psychoanalysts, and was thinking about the position
that an analyst assumes when she listens to an analysand. This involves
a total receptiveness to the other’s speech – which includes their
gestures, their tone of voice, their expressions. It also involves, as
it were, being a kind of placeholder, so that one’s presence is itself
an occasion for the speaker to continue speaking. If you speak, you do
so not to offer an interpretation but to remind the speaker that you
consent to their speech.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>I think <em>Je, tu, il, elle</em> is a film that invites the viewer
to do this sort of listening. It asks you to listen like a child, who
listens all the more intently for their lack of understanding. At the
same time, though, it also asks you to assume a particular position from
which to listen. Unlike the position of an infant, this position is
<em>sexed</em>.</p>
<p>What I find valuable in the specific way I assume a sexed position
when watching this film is that I am confronted directly with difference
and challenged to observe it – carefully, gently – rather than be
threatened by it. I think that’s also what makes this scene
<em>queer</em>, in the Bersanian sense anyway, in which the role of art
is to show us, imperfectly, our own image so that we might learn “to see
difference not as a trauma to be overcome but as a nonthreatening
supplement to sameness.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>I think the film demonstrates a similar mode of engagement in its
glances, its smiles, its attention to gesture. This mode of attention is
one which of course makes <em>Jeanne Dielman</em> so remarkable. While
in that film there is a lovingly meticulous attention to “the daily
gestures of a woman,” here there is a similarly loving attention paid to
the gaze of a woman observing, with rapt curiosity, the gestures of a
man.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> The middle section of <em>Je, tu,
il, elle</em> at once positions the viewer to identify with Julie – the
<em>Je</em> of the film’s title – while also quite powerfully
underlining the <em>difference</em> between Julie and the driver.</p>
<p>In their final scene together, Julie watches the truck driver wash up
in the bathroom. The man stands in front of a mirror, shaving his face
with an electric razor while Julie leans against the wall in the corner.
Her face is, for the most part, partially obscured by his arm movements,
but with the assistance of the mirror – and in the much brighter
lighting of the men’s room – we can follow the movement of her eyes. She
mirrors him: where he looks in his reflection, she looks too, though at
no point does she look into the mirror in order to do so. When he looks
away from his reflection, turning his attention downward to turn off the
shaver and clean it out, her gaze also moves downwards, towards his
hands. When he walks away from the sink to go to a urinal on the other
side of the bathroom, the camera moves in the opposite direction from
him, revealing a second mirror. Now we watch Julie, in the mirror on the
left, watching the man, in the mirror on the right, taking a piss in the
urinal. He returns to the sink to finish washing up and playfully taps
her on the nose.</p>

alt="A shot of two bathroom mirrors. Julie&#39;s reflection is in the left mirror, watching the driver, whose reflection appears in the right mirror, piss in a urinal" /></p>
<p>There’s an abrupt cut. Julie stands at the door of an apartment
building, speaking into an intercom. <em>“C’est moi.”</em> She’s let in,
ascends an elevator and enters a woman’s apartment. “I don’t want you to
stay,” the woman says. She begins to leave. As she starts to get in the
elevator, she says she’s hungry. The woman lets her back inside, makes
her a sandwich, which she eats. Julie smiles and nods.
<em>“Encore.”</em> The woman makes Julie two more sandwiches. She
doesn’t eat them. Instead, she begins to unbutton the woman’s blouse.
There isn’t much more to say after that.</p>
