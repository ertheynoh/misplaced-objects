    <h1>medieval death syllabus</h1>
  <div class="introduction">
      <p>Can death be represented? How do we think and form aesthetic
      relationships with what defies representation? While few things can be
      said to be as certain than the fact that our lives will end, Sigmund Freud
      nonetheless famously observed that it is “impossible to imagine our own
      death; and whenever we attempt to do so we can perceive that we are in
      fact still present as spectators.”<sup><a href="#fn1"
      id="ref1">1</a></sup> It’s a rather medieval observation – he
      even ends that same essay with an invocation of the medieval memento mori:
      <em>si vis vitam, para mortem</em>, that is, to endure life, prepare for
      death. For as central to our allegedly secular, allegedly scientific
      modernity as Freud’s observations about the unconscious have been, the
      comment gestures towards an understanding of life that is deeply
      structured by something that we can’t actually fully imagine or represent
      – however obsessively we may think around, or, as it may happen, be
      surrounded by it.</p>
      <p> One central concern of this class, then, is to approach death as a
      question of form. What form of thought, of articulation, of living, or of
      expression is appropriate for orienting oneself towards death? Is it the
      task of literature, art, philosophy, and other forms of speculative
      thought to console us and prepare us for death? Or is there a deeper, less
      utilitarian, sense in which they can bring thought to its own limits of
      signification and representability without eliminating it? </p>

    <h2>assignments</h2>
      <ul class="assignments">
	<li>Memento mori journal: 
	  <ul id="memento">
	    <li>Designate a journal, a folder in your notes app, or the like to
	    be your memento mori journal. Each week, record at least one moment
	    in which you were reminded of your own mortality, in which
	    something’s finitude felt “real” for a moment, or encountered an
	    object which in one way or another functioned as a memento mori.
	    Write it down for later, no more than a sentence or two. When you
	    have fifteen idle minutes, circle one word from the note you wrote
	    and set a timer. Try your best to write nonstop until the timer goes
	    off, describing a scene around the word you chose. It may be
	    fictional, or an attempt at reconstructing the moment or encounter,
	    a mixture of both, or something else entirely (whatever keeps your
	    thought going). Bring whatever you’ve written to class every Friday
	    morning.</li>
