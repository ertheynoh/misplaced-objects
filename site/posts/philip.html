    <h1 id="not-pretending">not pretending</h1>

      <p>Prompted by a conversation with a friend, I’d like to keep better notes
      on what I find interesting in comedy. As humorlessly as possible, of
      course.</p>

      <p>I don’t think it’s especially controversial for me to say that I like
      comedy but I don’t really like comedians. They do make me laugh sometimes,
      but I don’t really like them. Or, rather, there are limits to how much I
      can like them.</p>

      <p>The comedian often adopts the position of the complainer
      self-deprecatingly but not melancholically. The comedian-complainer
      doesn’t mock himself because he has internalized the negative traits of
      the other; rather, for him, self-deprecation is a means for maintaining a
      sense of control over the narrative. He is “in on” his own shortcomings;
      his self-deprecation is a means of signalling self-<em>knowledge</em>.
      This is sexed, of course. The self-deprecation of the male comedian is
      often a disavowal disguised as an avowal: he advertises – even flaunts –
      his own castration in order to sustain the fantasy that he remains ahead
      of it. By transforming his own shortcomings into “material,” he asserts
      that he is “in on” all the ways in which he isn’t.</p> 

      <p><em>Listen Up Philip</em> is about a writer, not a comedian, but he is
      insufferable and narcissistic in way that resembles one. He is a clown.
      The film begins with the titular character (played by Jason Schwartzman)
      walking to a diner to meet with an ex-girlfriend. Philip is already angry:
      “characteristically not in a hurry,” the narrator observes as Philip walks
      to the diner, he is nonetheless “perpetually enraged by slow foot traffic
      before him.” Mona is, of course, late to their meeting, which means that
      when she arrives she finds him “in a state of rage and on the verge of
      storming out.” She asks about his new book. <em>“I wasn’t sure you’d
      noticed, or heard,”</em> he responds. He lists the itinerary for his
      upcoming book tour, adding that he’s been <em>“told to expect big
      things”</em> on the West Coast. <em>“You sound like you’re bragging,”</em>
      she says. He then begins to monologue about how she had never believed in
      him.</p> 

      <blockquote> 

	<p>“That’s because I am bragging. And you’re doing a really hurtful job
	of sounding unfazed. And do you know why that is? Because you’re not
	pretending.”</p> 

      </blockquote> 

      <p>Mona says about sixty-five words in the minute-and-forty-five-second
      scene.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Most of her speech takes the form of
      her cautiously exasperated facial expressions, which punctuate Philip’s
      berating.</p>

      <p>Like a comedian, Philip, a writer, loves to hear himself talk. He also,
      infuriatingly, avows all of his own flaws: his narcissism, his coldness,
      his disregard for the feelings of others. His avowal of all the ways in
      which he is awful does not occasion the working-through of his own
      symptoms. Instead, his piggish narcissism provides him with an endless
      source of <em>content</em>: “Philip had never been one for speaking his
      mind,” the film’s narrator observes, “preferring instead to bottle up his
      emotions, eventually forgetting or utilizing them for creative
      inspiration.”</p> 

      <p><em>Listen Up Philip</em> is not a film a stand-up comedian could have
      made. On letterboxd I read a lot of comparisons between this film and
      those of Woody Allen. I am not convinced that Allen – a comedian – is
      capable of making a film so hateful of its own subject. It’s even in the
      title. That imperative: listen up. The film is speaking down – not to you,
      but to Philip. You are “in on” its mode of address – so long as you aren’t
      Philip, anyway.</p> 

      <p>Its comedy, then, lies in letting the audience in on all the ways
      Philip fails to remain in control of his own narrative because the people
      around him (primarily women) have all reached a point where they are no
      longer able to indulge his fantasies. They call him on his bluffs. Maybe
      this is one function of comedy: to deflate fantasies, to refuse to play
      along. If <em>Listen Up Philip</em> is particularly condescending to its
      titular character, perhaps it’s because Philip never gets to experience
      the deflation of his own fantasies as a <em>relief</em>. The film is about
      him, but nothing about it is <em>for</em> him. I suppose that’s what
      people call “cringe comedy.”</p>

	pretending”" />

      <p>I like how this film deals with sexual difference because the women in
      the film – Mona, Philip’s current girlfriend Ashley (played by Elizabeth
      Moss), Ike Zimmerman’s daughter Melanie (Krysten Ritter) – are introduced
      to at points in which their relationships with the film’s men are
      irreparably breaking down. At the same time, though, these women don’t
      simply serve to provide occasions for the men being insufferable pigs.
      When they exit the picture, their absence is felt, even if the men seem to
      be constitutionally unable to acknowledge that absence. Once he has
      destroyed his last remaining relationship, despite continuing to have
      success as a writer, Philip’s ego remains its own primary source of
      content. He spends the rest of his life “an isolated and emotionless
      specter, forever remaining a mystery, even to himself.” lol.</p>

	irreparable”" />

      <p>I think what’s also really smart about this film, though, is that it
      attends to the double-edged nature of this dynamic. If women aren’t simply
      objects who occasion scenes whose function is to illustrate something of a
      man’s character, neither is the inverse true. When the film shifts its
      perspective to that of Ashley, even if Philip’s absence provides the
      opportunity for newfound freedoms – like adopting a cat, or throwing a
      party, or getting a drink with a stranger – each of these various gestures
      feels like an attempt to fill an absence. This absence, however, precedes
      Philip. Even if in this film the women characters are more sympathetic,
      its gaze retains some distance from them: it doesn’t ask us to
      <em>identify</em> with these women because to do so would be to undermine
      a basic point the film wants to make about the inescapable loneliness of
      all of its characters.</p>

      <p>When, at the beginning of the film, Philip smirks as he dons his
      messenger bag and walks out the door, the camera starts to follow him, but
      then retraces its steps back to Mona. There’s a cut to her, wide-eyed.
      When I was jotting down my thoughts on the film after my first viewing,
      I’d misremembered this part of the scene, recalling, perhaps wishfully,
      that at this point Mona and the waitress behind the bar at the diner
      exchange a glance.</p>

      <p>I think I remembered it this way because there’s a commonplace in
      scenes like this. It goes something like this. A woman is subjected to a
      man (or men) being, well, annoying. Maybe he’s talking over her, or
      yelling at her, or explaining something to her she doesn’t need explained.
      Then another woman – a stranger – will make a kind of merciful and knowing
      eye contact with her.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> There is an exchange of looks, a
      reassuring and solidaristic moment of identification between two
      women.</p>

      <p>In fact, though, the film denies us the satisfaction of such an
      exchange. Mona’s eyes appear glazed, as if she is still processing the
      interaction she’s just had with Philip. Her gaze lingers in his direction
      for only an instant, before quickly turning away, fixed on no object.
      Without cutting, the camera moves once more, this time to bring the
      diner’s waitress into view. She looks at Mona inexpressively, indifferent
      to the scene which has just unfolded. She's just waiting, I suppose, for
      Mona to decide on what she wants to order.</p>
