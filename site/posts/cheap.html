    <h1 id="pretending-not">pretending not</h1>

      <p>One of the hallmarks of Chaucer’s writing is its unreliable narrators,
      the delight it takes in placing the reader at the mercy of its own lazy
      readers. Much of its humor comes from this——the dreamer in the <em>The
      Book of the Duchess</em> groggily misreading Ovid or failing to read
      between the lines of the Black Knight’s tale, for instance. In that dream,
      the story is only able to continue so long as the dreamer fails to connect
      the dots and deduce that the lover is dead: it’s upon realizing this that
      the dreamer wakes up and the story ends.</p> 

      <p>I wonder: if the comedic is located in a kind of reflexive deflation——
      in the staging of fantasy such that it appears, absurdly, as fantasy——is
      there a sense in which the fictional is located in the refusal to check
      one’s own facts——in reading poorly? I suspect that even for the most
      realist and scrupulously-researched fiction, at some point you have to
      refuse to know better, or act as though you don’t.</p> 

      <p>This is also, of course, one way of talking about ideology. I think,
      for instance, of China Mièville’s sci-fi neo-noir <em>The City and the
      City</em>, in which the denizens of two geographically overlapping nations
      collectively participate in sustaining their respective imagined
      communities by simply learning to “unsee” each other. The gimmick doesn’t
      really hold your interest for very long, though. Maybe because the novel
      is so humorless. I wonder if fiction can have anything to say about
      ideology if it isn’t funny.</p> 

      <p>And I think what I mean by “funny” here is something like: a story
      which, if it didn’t prompt laughter, would only appear schizophrenic: the
      pieces don't quite fit together; it fails to provide a world for its own
      pretensions. If there were a world in which those pretensions could be
      sustained, the story would cease to be comedic. Can a joke be funny if it
      can’t be ruined?</p> 

      <p>If China Mièville were a better writer, perhaps
      <em>The City and the City</em> would have been a comedic novel, rather
      than merely a gimmicky one. I think “3:30,” a tiny little story in Parker
      Young’s recent collection <em>Cheap Therapist Says You’re Insane</em>,
      gets it better. Here’s how it begins:</p> 

      <blockquote> <p>Walking the city grid at 3:30pm with all the other
      unemployed people. We pretend not to notice each other. It’s a deal we
      struck when we got tired of explaining. (162)</p> </blockquote> 

      <p>Ideology yields to exhaustion. An epistemic downward spiral: we’re too
      tired to explain; we know nothing. As the narrator’s grandmother believed,
      people all have the ability to receive premonitions, but “avoid them
      because they’re mostly unbearable,” avoiding the truth so well that they
      don’t even know they’re avoiding it anymore.</p> 

      <p>But they’re still, on some level, always <em>pretending</em>. The
      unconscious always knows better, or whatever. Fantasy pretends not to. It
      interprets without considering, after a certain point, questions like
      <em>how do you know?</em> “This is why I’ve failed so far in my career to
      write essays,” the narrator explains, “I never provide the appropriate
      details.”</p> 

      <p>Pretending becomes humorous when it is contradicted: when the pretender
      appears in a world which neglects to provide the "appropriate details."
      The narrator imagines, at the drug store, that a “ne’er-do-well” could,
      hypothetically, put poison on the tops of the deodorant containers,
      killing clueless shoppers without anyone knowing the cause. “I ask to
      speak to the manager.” The world fails to supply the details that would
      make the scenario at all plausible. “Get lost,” they’re told.</p> 

      <blockquote> <p>I look at him with a look that says, you just blew a
      fucking million-dollar idea. It’s a look I learned from television, where
      it appears with a surprising and almost sinister regularity.</p>
      </blockquote> 

      <p>The story has now become a situation. It’s become sitcom, a genre whose
      characters are “selfish and deranged, delicious micromenaces to normalcy
      and etiquette who nonetheless enter and leave each episode with their
      worlds intact.” Those words are <a
      href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/08/seinfeld-rewatch-close-read.html">Lauren
      Jackson’s</a>, who specifically calls attention to the whiteness of such
      characters——in <em>Seinfeld</em>, in <em>Friends</em>——and to the ways
      Black characters appear in these television shows as “agents of public
      decency,” as avatars of a world that fails to supply the appropriate
      details. I think, too, of the blank stare of the diner waitress at the
      beginning of <a href="philip.html"><em>Listen Up Philip</em></a>.</p>
      
      <p>Here, though, the world that fails to supply the appropriate details
      that would sustain our fantasies is one in which everyone is just
      unemployed and broke. Flailing for a job. Trying, and failing, to gesture
      towards something like a “normal”——employed——life.</p> 

      <p>Our narrator proceeds to sprinkle sugar on the deodorants to make the
      case for the job they’ve proposed that only they can fill, that is, to be
      the one who checks the tops of the deodorants for poison. They attempt to
      provide some details, but they aren't the appropriate ones. They’re kicked
      out, screaming: they'd entered the store because they needed to buy
      deodorant, but now can't. “Fortunately, everyone outside pretends not to
      notice.”</p>
