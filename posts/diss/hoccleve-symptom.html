<h1 id="hoccleve-the-symptom">Hoccleve the symptom</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, I explored some of the ways in which the
symptom appears in Chaucer’s writing as a technology of identification.
In <em>The Book of Duchess</em>, the symptom – the <em>I</em> – takes on
a kind of indexicality through the impersonal specificity of its
<em>traits</em>, that is, those “point[s] of coincidence”<span
class="citation" data-cites="freudgroup"><a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></span> along which a kind of
sociability between the reader and the text might be enunciated. The
symptom’s capacity to enable identification can be carried to extremes,
however. In the case of the <em>Prioress’s Tale</em>, for instance, one
thing that the tale of the little clergeon dramatizes is the way in
which the symptom can serve to enable fantasies of unification to a
pathological extent. One notes the clergeon’s role in the fantasies of
both the Prioress himself and his single mother, ultimately functioning
in the place of the Prioress’s <em>objet a</em> as he is put in the
position of having to subordinate himself to performing the role of an
object that might embody what the mother lacks.</p>
<p>What these two texts share in relation to thinking about the symptom
is the way it can draw a subject <em>in</em> to a relation with an
other. In the <em>Book</em>, the reader is drawn into a relation with
the dreamer by way of our recognition of his melancholic symptoms of
sleeplessness, dread, and heaviness. The displacement of the <em>I</em>
and decentering of the autographical in the <em>Canterbury Tales</em>
doesn’t do away with this function of the symptom, but rather allows for
the interrogation of it within different scenes. For the Prioress, the
child-symptom serves as the anchorpoint for an ultimately fascistic
fantasy of wholeness which Aranye Fradenburg diagnosed as operating on a
desire to “erase the difference between word and thing.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="fradenburgprioress"><a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> In the present chapter, I
turn to the writing of the early fifteenth century poet Thomas Hoccleve,
whose turn away from the autographical is not towards the novelistic
heteroglossia of the <em>Canterbury Tales</em> but towards a rather
startling psychological realism. Hoccleve’s writing begins with the
breaking down of the <em>I</em>. He trades the autographical for the
autobiographical, deriving a kind of literary authority from his unique
take on “My Compleinte.” I begin by attending to this mode and
Hoccleve’s take on it as it appears in the <em>Compleynte paramont</em>
and <em>La Male regle</em>.</p>
<p>While in Boethian poetics the complaint plays an important role, it’s
generally presented as a prelude to the reparative discourse of
consolation. As I argued in my first chapter, for Boethius the
<em>telos</em> of consolation is perpetually deferred, and the
introduction of a split between will and desire proceeds on the
supposition that desire – that is, <em>true</em> desire – always tends
towards the Good. Though the subject can <em>will</em> their own death,
human desire is always a desire for unity with the Good – whether that
good lies with Nature or with God. What the <em>Consolation of
Philosophy</em> relies on, ultimately, is an account of Nature in which
there is life-driven procreation but no <em>sexuality</em>, which would
threaten the wholeness of Nature by introducing a lack at its center.
What interests me in Hoccleve, though, is the way his poetry foregrounds
the negative: it takes cynicism, world-weariness, and irony to comprise
its founding point of reference. It’s a melancholic discourse, but a
<em>damning</em> one: it turns language against itself; it rebels
against the signifier. At least in Hoccleve’s minor poems, too, there’s
an important sense in which the complaint leaves the reparative and the
consolatory outside its frame of reference. In so doing it also raises
the question of sex insofar as it narrates the ways in which complaint
is a mode of jouissance, a fragmenting of the body by way of
language.</p>
<p>This jouissance is given voice most famously in Hoccleve’s
<em>Series</em>, in which the autographical <em>I</em> is assembled, in
a sense, in reverse. Rather than drawing the reader into the text by way
of deictic identification with the <em>I</em>, in Hoccleve the pleasure
of the text might be traced by way of the <em>I</em>’s dissolution and
reassembly. As Julie Orlemanski puts it, if for the Chaucer of the
<em>Canterbury Tales</em>, <em>plot</em> serves as “the literary form
most apt for thinking about etiology – which could orchestrate various
systems of causation into a single sequence of events and demand
readerly puzzling over which causes really made things happen,” then
Hoccleve’s privileged form is <em>narration</em>, with the work of
<em>writing itself</em> functioning, in a sense, to speak an <em>I</em>
into being.<span class="citation" data-cites="symptomaticSubjects"><a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span> In <em>La Male Regle</em>,
“My Compleinte,” and the “Dialoge,” writing becomes a kind of stammering
speech, a writing of jouissance that unravels its own signifiers.
Hoccleve’s <em>I</em> resists the deictic pretension to universality by
merit of its own precariousness and fragmentation. Insofar as Hoccleve’s
complaining begins from a place of dissolution and alienation, it
doesn’t take the truth of desire for granted in quite the same way as
the <em>Consolation</em> does. If, for Boethius, what makes desire
<em>true</em> is that it by definition takes the good as its object, for
the Hocclevean complaint truth is uncertain insofar as it’s
<em>inexistent</em>, that is, produced retroactively. This is the
principle of the symptom as Lacan (following Marx) would come to
formulate it in his later work: a symptom always presupposes a truth
which is “inexistent,” which doesn’t mean that it “doesn’t exist” so
much as it exists, logically, in retrospect. It exists insofar as the
symptom which presupposes it “marks out its place.”<span

the <em>Compleynte paramont</em></h2>
<p>Complaint, as Lauren Berlant expressed it in <em>The Female
Complaint</em>, is a genre characterized by ambivalent attachments. It
speaks to both the disappointment resulting from “the failure of
relation” and the survival of “some fidelity to the world of distinction
and desire that produced such disappointment in the first place.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="berlantComplaint"><a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> It’s a “genre,” but also a
mode – of investment, of backhanded attachment, and of enjoyment. In
Jewish humor, complaining – <em>kvetching</em> – “can be applied
indifferently to hunger or satiety”:<span class="citation"
data-cites="wexkvetch"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span> the <em>kvetcher</em> takes a
special pleasure in complaining about complaining, about having
complained, and about others who complain. The Yiddish word
<em>kvetch</em> is derived from the Middle High German
<em>quetschen</em>, meaning to crush, bruise, or squeeze;<span
class="citation" data-cites="OEDkvetch"><a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span> but Michael Wex makes sure to
highlight the anality of the Jewish translation of the word into its
rich culture of complaint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It isn’t simply to strain, but “to strain,” as Harkavy has it, “at
stool,” to have trouble doing what, if you’d eaten your prunes the way
you were supposed to, you wouldn’t have any trouble with at all. […] A
really good kvetch has a visceral quality, a sense that the kvetcher
won’t be completely comfortable, completely satisfied, until it’s all
come out.<span class="citation" data-cites="wexkvetch"><a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The true <em>kvetcher</em>, though, is never completely comfortable.
They withhold their own satisfaction, remaining within the scene of
complaint. The complaint of the habitual <em>kvetch</em>, then, has an
object, but it isn’t necessarily the one that occasions her kvetching at
a given moment. To complain is to attend to the fact that there’s
something lacking in the real, which is to say that it touches the real
through the presupposition of a fantasy. Complaint is itself a mode of
“negotiating belonging to a world,”<span class="citation"
data-cites="berlantComplaint"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></span> even it proceeds
from a dogged attachment to what’s lacking in it. Complaint is a
symptomatic discourse; it always has an object whose inexistence it both
marks out and is occasioned by; it demands a supplement, which often
must be created by way of what it occasions in the first place.</p>
<p>Thomas Hoccleve is one of Middle English poetry’s most prolific
kvetches. In the <em>Compleynte paramont</em>, his translation of a
Marian lament from Guillaume de Deguileville’s <em>Le Pèlerinage de
l’Âme</em>, grief tips over into the realm of complaint when the
subject’s loss of a beloved object is world shattering, and brings into
view a sense of loss that precedes the loss of the object in question.
Narrated from the perspective of the Virgin Mary, the <em>Compleynte
paramont</em> is uttered from a place of utter despair. At least within
what’s preserved in the passage selected by Hoccleve for translation,
absent is the temporal logic of Boethian fortune. The speaker’s “ioye
hath made a permutacioun” – an exchange – “With wepyng and eek
lamentacioun,”<span class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span> and within the moment of
agony the poem articulates, the anticipation of that joy returning is
circumscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O Gaubriel, whan that thou come aplace<br />
And madest vnto me thi salewyng<br />
And seidist thus, “Heil Mary, ful of grace,”<br />
Whi ne had thu gove me warnyng<br />
Of that grace that veyn is and faylyng,<br />
As thu now seest, and sey it weel beforne?<span class="citation"
data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shattering effects of loss reverberate in all directions,
resignifying what precedes it. It reveals grace to be “vain,” and divine
hailing to have proceeded from the deceptive withholding of knowledge.
This is the site that complaint takes as its founding point of
reference, however contingently: contemptuously looking upwards from the
nadir of existence.</p>
<p>It’s this positioning of the subject of complaint that is of interest
to the considerations of the present chapter. The Marian complaint here
begins with grief over <em>difference</em> – specifically, that between
mother and son, and figures Christ as an ambivalent object of
attachment. “It seemeth that thow makist departynge / Twixt thee and me
for ay withoute endynge,” she laments, making special note of the
impersonal way in which he addresses her: “And namely syn thow me
‘womman’ callist, / As I to thee straunge wer and vnknowe. / Therthurgh,
my sone, thow my ioie appallist.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></span> More than grieving the loss
of a son what she laments is his <em>separation</em> from her. Who
enacts that separation? The Father or the Son? It’s this entanglement of
<em>taking</em> and <em>losing</em> that renders the Christ into an
unbearably ambivalent object in this scene, as the loved object becomes,
too, the agent responsible for the destruction of her joy.</p>
<p>The ambivalence I’m trying to emphasize in this passage can perhaps
be clarified by way of a reminder of iterability of the father function
in Freudian psychoanalysis. Within a certain trajectory of Lacanian
readings of Freud, there is a particular emphasis on impersonality of
the Father as a <em>function</em>. As Willy Apollon articulates it in
his rereading of the Freudian Oedipal scene, this renders the family
itself into a “problematic” in which “<em>the father</em> or the
function of the father comes <em>to articulate a limit, to install the
time of a loss.</em> He renders possible an object for desire, as long
as this object is lost, inaccessible, or impossible. The <em>father</em>
is then a <em>separator</em> […].”<span class="citation"
data-cites="apollonpsychoses carlson2010"><a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></span> Or, as Lucie Cantin writes,
“The father has no raison d’être other than to represent the law of the
symbolic,” and the performance of his function is somewhat portable:
“The father is thus whoever is named as ‘father.’ He is <em>not</em> the
father, strictly speaking, merely because he may have impregnated the
female.”<span class="citation" data-cites="afterlacan"><a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span> What the Marian scene
re-enacts is the particular violence of this function when its falls
upon the child to perform it. The child, here, is the mother’s
<em>symptom</em>: he “gives her, in immediately accessible form, what
the masculine subject lacks: the very object of his existence appearing
in the real.”<span class="citation" data-cites="lacanChild"><a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></span> Insofar as the child is the
mother’s symptom, his function is, in a sense, to occupy the space left
empty by her lost object. In the scene of Marian complaint, this dynamic
can be traced in her total identification with her symptom by way of a
process which exceeds the limits of life itself.<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>Hoccleve’s translation of the lyric is marked by a particular
sensitivity to and emphasis on this moment of identification, in which
grief has moved from world-shattering resignification, to the
confrontation with the ambivalence of the loved object, and, finally, to
a shattering of the self. As I touched upon in the previous chapter, one
facet of Marian fantasy is a collapse of difference with the loved
object; here, this is articulated in the jouissance of the destruction
of the <em>I</em>: “Wel may men clepe and calle me Mara / From
hennesforward, so may men me call. / How sholde I lenger clept be Maria,
/ Syn ‘I’, which is Ihesus, is fro me fall.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></span> The play on spelling – and
on the courtly language of “sweetness and gall” (“Mara” being itself a
name derived from the Latin <em>amare</em>, bitterness) – slips into the
grammatical a few stanzas later, when Mary’s suffering provocatively
risks tipping over into the experience of Christ’s death as her own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For now the taast I feele and the streynynge<br />
Of deeth. By thy deeth feele I deeth me stynge.<br />
O poore modir, what shalt thow now seye?<br />
Poore Marie, thy wit is aweye.<br />
 <br />
Marie? Nay, but ‘marred’ I thee calle.<br />
Vessel of care and wo and sorwes alle.<br />
Now thow art frosty cold, now fyry hoot,<br />
And right as that a ship or barge or boot<br />
Among the wawes dryueth steerelees,<br />
So doost thow, woful womman, confortlees.<span class="citation"
data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoccleve’s rendering of the poem into rhyme royal in English is in
part responsible for the devastating line break which results in the
triple repetition of the word “deeth” on line 215. In the lines which
follow – and for the remainder of the poem – the “I” is displaced, as
the second person addressee is no longer God/Christ but Mary herself.
Not only does her “wit” wander away, with her maternal function having
been exhausted so too does her motherly “style”. “And of modir haast
thow eek lost the style,” this new ghostly “I” entones, “No more maist
thow clept be by thy name.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></span> What’s striking about the
function of complaint here is that it doesn’t appear to foreclose
redemption, but it does locate the speaker prior to its arrival, in a
moment when it is circumscribed and only present as a potentiality which
has yet to make its imprint on the complaining utterance itself. In the
<em>Compleynte paramont</em>, there’s no mention of “redemption” until
the final line of the poem.<span class="citation"
data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Though firmly positioned in the negative, the complaint marks the
space of what it lacks: the object to which it’s attached is preserved
insofar as it structures its entire discourse even in its inexistence.
The complainer is compelled to speak by and through the loved object
which she’s lost and never had but continues to create space and speech
for nonetheless. In the <em>Compleynte paramont</em>, before it brings
the poetic death of the speaker, the loss of the “I” occasions an
overflowing of speech: “Of sorwe talke may I nat ynow,” the Virgin
complains, “Syn fro my name ‘I’ doon away is now.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></span> While complaint is a
symptomatic discourse, its structure – that is, the shape or trajectory
of the desire its narrative belies – isn’t determined by its symptom so
much as it is articulated through it. While the “original” and famously
autobiographical poems Hoccleve is now better remembered for articulate
structurally distinct desires and narrative trajectories than the
<em>Compleynte paramont’s</em> Marian mode, these later works do share
an interest in symptomatic discourse, particularly in the way that the
complaint begins in negativity and self-difference.</p>
<p>The articulation of self-difference – of the representation of the
dysphoria that results from feeling other to oneself that recurs so
frequently in Hoccleve’s writing – is also of course importantly sexed
here. This is perhaps a banal observation to make about a Marian lament
lyric, but is nevertheless striking in light of Hoccleve’s more personal
work. The figure of a wandering “wit” so famously associated with <em>My
Complaint</em> (more on this later) of course makes its appearance here,
but in a distinct overflowing of jouissance, in which the speaker is
eliminated by and alongside her object, “wit” and “style” spilling out
along with the “I.” This, of course, proceeds from an unbearable
recognition of sexual difference: in the strangeness, for instance, of
being called “woman” by her own son (“As I to thee straunge wer and
vnknowe”),<span class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></span> and in the severance so
harsh that the entire experience of having been a mother takes on a new
darker hue. Another, earlier, moment in which Mary apparently addresses
herself in the second person is when she addresses the former self who
had carried and nursed Christ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O womman that among the peple speek,<br />
How that the wombe blessid was that beer,<br />
And the tetes that yaf to sowken eek<br />
The sone of God, which on hy hangith heer,<br />
What seist thow now, why comest thow no neer?<span class="citation"
data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Especially contrasted with her current state, the passage is
remarkable for its emphasis on the sensuality of motherhood. In
<em>Mothers</em>, Jacqueline Rose muses on the ways in which the
idealization of motherhood obscurs the centrality of pleasure and pain
to it, recalling a quip of Jean Laplanche’s regarding the absence in art
and psychoanalytic writing of representations of breastfeeding. “I have
known mothers who stopped breastfeeding,” she notes, “simply because
they felt they were liking it too much.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="roseMothers"><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></span> In another
moment in the <em>Compleynte</em>, the speaker reminisces on all the
moments in which her child snuggled up in her arms, or sat upon her
knee, with kissing slipping into sucking: “Thow sat and haddist many a
kus of me. / Eek thee to sowke on my brestes yaf Y, / Thee norisshyng
fair and tendrely.”<span class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></span> This provocatively erotic
representation of breastfeeding may offer a nice counter-example to
Laplanche’s comment, and hardly less so for the unrecoverability of the
enjoyment they speak to, in part because it’s world-shattering loss of
the object that brings into view the extent to which that world was
structured by the object’s presence in the first place.</p>
<p>Despite the poem’s overtly melancholic register, too, and despite the
way in which this jouissance comes into view when the speaker is forced
to confront herself as an <em>other</em>, the poem doesn’t begin and end
with a melancholic theory of gender. The speaker isn’t <em>less</em>
feminized, for instance, for her present condition, in which she finds
herself “barren” of joy<span class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a
href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></span> and with a “woful
wombe.”<span class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></span> Rather, something like a
“feminine jouissance” is found in the poem not in the signifiers of
femaleness or femininity – or, for that matter, their lack – as much as
it appears as something immanent in the complaint itself, which weaves
together the extremes of pleasure and pain into a discursive whole that
paradoxically constitutes the subject in the very process of its
unraveling. It’s from this register that the jouissance of the text
proceeds: in the literal coming-apart of language on the level of the
letter, in these silent shifts in grammatical subject/object, and in
this unarticulatable distance between motherhood at its most serene and
most abject. It’s this non-communicative excess of language from which
this “other jouissance” arises that Lacan referred to as
<em>lalangue</em>, and which language, short of being able to represent,
certainly speaks to it and strives to know it: “Language is what we try
to know concerning the functioning of llanguage
[<em>lalangue</em>].”<span class="citation" data-cites="lacansem20"><a

<h2 id="money-as-symptom-la-male-regle">Money as symptom: <em>La Male
Regle</em></h2>
<p>Compare this with Hoccleve’s <em>Male Regle</em>, which begins with a
description of the speaker’s unwellness. “And now my body empty is, and
bare / Of ioie and ful of seekly heuynesse,” Hoccleve laments, in lines
striking if for no other reason than for their recollection of the
<em>Compleynte paramont</em>’s language of emptiness and heaviness.<span
class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></span> In <em>La Male Regle</em>
the speaker is also looking back on a former self from the perspective
of a miserable present, though the tone now is comical and
mock-penitential. The first part of the poem consists in this disclosure
of sin which begins, as it does for many, in the speaker’s youth. This
youthfulness appears, for a moment, in prosopopoeial form, and the
speaker’s “unwary youth” is referred to with feminine pronouns: “Myn
vnwar yowth kneew nat what it wroghte,” he writes, “whan fro thee
twynned shee. / But of hir ignorance hirself shee soghte, / And kneew
nat that shee dwellyng was with thee.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></span> The feminine
pronouns drop, however, when the invocation of “youth” moves to more
general proclamation that “for the more paart, youthe is rebel / Vnto
reson.”<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn31"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></span> The moment stands out if
only because <em>La Male Regle</em> is not a poem that is otherwise
especially interested in allegory. Though the poem is addressed to
“helthe,” the word only comes up three times in the poem,<span
class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></span> and the concerns of the
speaker wander substantially with respect to the question of his own
health.</p>
<p>In fact, this passing reference to the speaker’s own youth in this
way is an example of one of the poem’s many diversions in the unfolding
of its speaker’s symptomatic discourse. While the insistance of “another
jouissance” can be traced in the gap between the maternal pleasure the
<em>Compleynte paramont</em>’s speaker enjoys in her youth and the
abjection of her narrative present, in <em>La Male Regle</em> the
attempt to draw a contrast between the speaker’s past self and present
immediately falls flat and is forgotten. This is because in the
temporality of the poem’s symptomatic discourse, this “unwary youth” is
very much part of the speaker’s narrative present in his writing of an
<em>ongoing</em> ailment. The “letter” of the speaker’s symptom – the
signifier, that is, around which it is organized – lies elsewhere,
providing the <em>Male Regle</em>’s speaker with a fundamentally
different relationship to his own enjoyment than what is seen in the
Deguileville translation. Far from staging the speaker’s identification
with his symptom, what’s notable about <em>La Male Regle</em> is that it
self-consciously presents itself as a “writing of jouissance” with and
against the signifier with which its symptom is embroiled. The poem’s
discourse, in other words, is symptomatic insofar as the poem speaks
itself as its own symptom.</p>
<p>After broadly condemning youthful rebellion against reason, the first
section of the main body of the poem mainly consists in the recounting
of the speaker’s various wrongdoings. The speaker’s principal sins are
gluttony and drunkenness, sins which are from the start tied to money.
The speaker notes that he’d been inclined to drink as often as he
could,<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn33"

<p>Money functions as the signifier around which the speakers symptom
takes shape: it functions to limit the enjoyment of the narrator’s
“greedy mowth,”<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a
href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></span> without which he would
simply never stop shoving things in it. By providing his illness with a
limit, however, money also grants it a shape and a temporality: it marks
its pathology as something other than something characteristic of the
subject’s “nature” or as a passing illness by granting it a rhythm. It
makes the symptom <em>repeatable</em> and imbues it with a rhythm,
providing a scene to which the subject is compelled to return to over
and over again. Money structures his pathological tendency towards
“excess,” but it also provides the rhetorical conceit around which the
poem’s tongue-in-cheek irony turns when its affected penitential tone is
revealed to have been a complaint all along.</p>
<p>It’s on this point that the subject’s relationship with himself “as
an other” is already radically distinct from that of the speaker in the
<em>Compleynte paramont.</em> In the latter, the movement of the
speaker’s lament is carried along by a desire to overcome the difference
between the subject and its object, even if this requires the shattering
or death of the subject. Marian devotion is <em>erotic</em>: its desire
is to transform two into one.<span class="citation"

id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></span> For the speaker
of the <em>La Male Regle</em>, however, the object itself induces a
split: if one will excuse the terminology, money partakes in a wholly
“phallic” symbolic economy, insofar as it functions at the place of the
phallus as limit to enjoyment while at the same time providing the terms
on which the subject is able to enjoy at all. This is a “masculine”
structure, insofar as the terms of enjoyment are incomplete without this
limit, and insofar as the object “keeps the symbolic moving in the same
circuitous paths, in constant <em>avoidance</em> of the real.”<a
href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> Whereas Marian jouissance proceeds
indifferent to the limits of language and life itself, in <em>La Male

data-cites="finksubject"><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></span> as the pleasure
of the text is folded back on itself by way of its layers of
self-deprecating irony.</p>
<p>One of these layers appears in the way Hoccleve represents his own
masculinity in this section. While there seems to have been no shortage
of beautiful women passing through among the taverngoers at his regular
haunts,<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn39"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a></span> he recalls that he never
slept with any of them, and that, given the opportunity to, he would
have been perfectly content with just a kiss: “Of loues aart yit touchid
I no deel. / I cowde nat, and eek it was no neede, / Had I a kus, I was
content ful weel, / Bettre than I wolde hand be with the deede. /
Thereon can I but smal, it is no dreede.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></span> And despite the
rambunctiousness of tavern culture and his reputation as a regular
amongst it, he insists upon the consistency of his “manly cowardyse”
preventing him from ever slandering anyone – at least, that is, “on
highte” – lest it come to blows.<span class="citation"
data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></span> As I discussed
in the case of <em>Silence</em> when the titular character is being
aggressively pursued by the queen, it’s the <em>anticipation</em> of
inadequacy that informs Hoccleve’s timidity in these scenes. Here, the
risk of an encounter – whether sexual or combative – is something the
subject flirts with but doesn’t go all the way through with; he is never
bold enough to risk his actual emasculation moving beyond the level of a
threat. Such is the assumption of “manly cowardice”: not that one
doesn’t “have it” (that is, the “phallus”) but precisely the opposite,
insofar as what the manly coward fears most is having “it” taken
away.</p>
<p>It’s with exactly this kind of backhandedness that Hoccleve
establishes something like an authoritative poetic voice throughout the
poem. The next major part of the poem consists of an extended rant
against flatterers. The digression is prompted by the recollection of a
time when he’s headed home drunk and decides, lazily, to pay for a boat
ride back. “Other than maistir callid was I nevere,” he observes, noting
that the politeness never failed to prompt him to tip well: “So tikelid
me that nyce reuerence / that it me made larger of despense.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn42"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></span> It’s a clever moment of
tongue-in-cheek self-deprecation, as the purpose of this doubling down
on his own sloth and gluttony ultimately provides the material for a
diversion. What follows is a lengthy digression as the speaker laments
the ways in which the worst “combreworldes” – world-encumberers – of all
are flatterers and “enchantours,”<span class="citation"
data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref"

speaker’s own history of gluttony and sloth, one may suppose, it may at
least be observed that he’s honest.</p>
<p>The poem of course begins as a confession, and upon ending the
digression with a pithy final condemnation of “excess,”<span
class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn45"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></span> the speaker begins to
loquaciously, and perhaps even with a hint of fondness, reflect upon his
history with it once more:</p>
<blockquote>

By nytirtale out of al mesure,<br />
For, as in that, fynde kowde I no macche<br />

</blockquote>
<p>“Go we now” to watch the night all the way through: this invitation
in the present tense to stay up all night prompts in Hoccleve the memory
of many nights spent drinking himself to sleep. One assumes, though,
that with this “go we now,” Hoccleve isn’t sitting and pouring himself
another drink but coming to terms with the consequences of his actions.
The temporality of “go we now” is ambiguous. Even as the recounting of
historical drunkenness implies the sins that the speaker recounts to
belong in the past, the “now” in which the reminiscence is prompted
speaks to an ongoing condition as the speaker grasps for more footholds
to fill in the space left by lack of drink with words.</p>
<p>It’s a motivating conceit of the poem that the sickness suffered by
the speaker is one “<em>As wel</em> of purs as body,”<span
class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn47"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></span> and it’s the ongoing
sickness of Hoccleve’s <em>purse</em> which remains the emphasis for the
remainder of the poem. As he embarks on another digression about the
importance of moderation in spending one’s coin, he catches himself
rambling: “Ey, what is me, that to myself thus longe / Clappid haue I? I
trowe that I raue. / A, nay, my poore purs and peynes stronge / Han
artid me speke as I spoken haue.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></span> What’s
remarkable about Hoccleve’s use of digressions is precisely the way he
frames them as empty speech. Truly, they are <em>diversions</em> from
the actual object of the poem – and the poem does very much
<em>want</em> something. Hoccleve’s digressions are clearly defensive:
what the digression on “enchanters,” for instance, would seem to want to
imply is that for all the speaker’s “excess,” it at least may be said
that he is honest, and that despite the “sickness” of his purse that he
really, in fact, does have a genuinely good command of just price theory
and abstinence. Given how Hoccleve himself has described his illness as
a <em>compulsion</em>, one may well ask whether this moment of
impoverishment is simply the prelude to another drunken binge, as it’s
this “sickness of purse and body” that physically and financially
prevents him from continuing more than anything else.</p>
<p>But this perfectly logical deduction would perhaps itself be the
outcome of another backhandedly ironizing gesture. What Hoccleve finally
leaves us with is not a petition to “Helthe,” but to his patron, who he
now addresses in order to ask for his £10 annuity and to remind him that
he still owes the speaker payment for previous years.<span
class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn49"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></span> It’s on this latter detail
that the ending of the poem slips from confession to complaint: “I dar
nat speke a word of ferne yeer, / So is my spirit symple and sore
agast.”<span class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn50"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></span> While what the poem demands
is the payment of an owed wage, what the rhetorical shift suggests is
that the speaker’s “sickness of purse” may not entirely be the result of
his own bad habits, but may at least in part result from a history of
neglect on the part of his patron. It’s here where the poem shifts to
complaint, insofar as the thing that its speaker lacks speaks to a
history of that lack which precedes the narrative present of the poem
itself, a present in which the condition produced by this history of
lacking is very much ongoing. It’s exactly in this turn to complaint,
though, that Hoccleve does something quite radical: he makes a
<em>demand</em>, and he <em>names</em> the Other from which the poem
makes that demand by addressing the poem to Lord Fourneval.<span
class="citation" data-cites="hoccleveregle"><a href="#fn51"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Insofar as the poem is written in order to petition for the payment
of a wage, there is a sense in which money is in itself the poem’s
symptom, insofar as it would appear to be the thing the speaker most
wants. Because the speaker lacks that object, this lack occasions the
poem itself and colors its scenes. It’s this distance from the object
that preserves it, however: unlike in the case of the <em>Compleynte
paramont</em>, there’s no sense in which the speaker <em>identifies</em>
with his object, except insofar as he remains attached to the scene
which it symptomatically structures. Rather than appearing as a
world-shattering event, the loss of the object is ordinary, and is even
in a sense pleasurable, at least to the extent that it produces a scene
that he keeps returning to. It’s the anticipation of this loss happening
again (and again) which emplots the use he makes of the object in the
first place.</p>
<p>In that sense, at least until a certain point in the poem, money
would appear to be the speaker’s symptom: we can trace the speaker’s
illness along its path, and see that insofar as it occupies the space
left by his <em>objet a</em> it also obfuscates it by locking him into a
self-destructive cycle of false need and false desires. Hence the
fleetingness of Hoccleve’s metaphors and digressions: the feminine,
prosopopoeial “youth” dissipates as quickly as she is summoned because
what she is invoked to give form to is in fact also embodied by the
speaker himself in speaking her into being. The poem symptomatizes
itself for its object; its speaker speaks himself as a scene which is
made intelligible by its object’s lack. And of course it does: as the
poem nears the end and shifts to the register of complaint it confesses
itself to have not been a confession in the first place and
retroactively provides the terms of its own fictionality. This is of
course a conceit: the poem wryly reveals the speaker’s self-deprecating
persona <em>as a persona</em> in an ironic twist that itself serves as
the passive aggressive set-up to ask its audience for payment in a sense
not altogether dissimilar to the plaint about spendthrifts that begins
<em>Le Roman de Silence</em>, or any number of troubador lyrics.</p>
<p>I would suggest that there’s also something deflating in the way
Hoccleve levels the demand at the end of the poem. By addressing his
specific patron by name, and by writing in an autobiographical rather
than autographical mode, Hoccleve calls attention to the symptomatic
function of money in his own poem. No longer does the poem appear to be
addressed to God or “helthe,” but more specifically to a certain Lord
Fournival; and the rehearsal of the subject’s gluttonous repetition
compulsion whose cycles are determined by the phallic signifier of money
take on a new character when the complaint shifts its mode of address
from its own self-demeaning and ill speaker to a <em>failing on the part
of the Other</em> who his discourse is revealed to have been addressing
all along.</p>
<p>In psychoanalytic terms, what the writing of signifier of money
<em>as a signifier</em> here does, then, is to help shift our attention
away from the scene of the signifier – whose jouissance is centered on
the subject’s castration – and brings to its attention the <em>Other’s
castration</em>. “It is important to note,” Apollon writes, “that the
<em>symptom</em> has more to do with <em>the failure of the
signifier</em> than with the loss that signifies the subject’s
castration. It’s the <em>jouissance at stake in the symptom</em> that
relates more radically to the <em>Other’s castration</em>, in that the
Other’s castration is the mode in which the failing of language is
verified.”<span class="citation" data-cites="afterlacan"><a href="#fn52"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a></span> What’s most remarkable about
<em>La Male Regle</em> lies in the fact that this ironic turn by which
confession transforms into complaint casts the authority of this
signifier into doubt, shifting the site of the speaker’s enjoyment from
the repetition of the signfier’s scene to the writing of the symptom
itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-complainers-impasse">The complainer’s impasse</h2>
<p>In the later period of his career, Lacan would come to view the
symptom (or <em>sinthome</em>) as itself a creative supplement invented
by the subject around which they might organize a coherent mode of
jouissance. Lacan’s privileged case study for this is James Joyce, for
whom art functioned as a supplement through which his subject could
cohere in a very particular mode. On the one hand, insofar as Joyce
expressly wanted to create work “to <em>keep the critics busy for three
hundred years</em>,” there is a keen sense in which “his art is the true
guarantor of his phallus.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="lacansem23"><a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a></span> The paradox of
the symptom is that while its function is, in a sense, to make the
Symbolic, the Real, and the Imaginary cohere, there is also a sense in
which it <em>abolishes</em> the symbolic: it turns language against
itself and forecloses a certain degree of communicability. For Lacan, by
the time Joyce is writing <em>Finnegans Wake</em>, it’s clear that he’s
“cancelled his subscription to the unconscious,”<span class="citation"
data-cites="lacansem23"><a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></span> demonstrating
the ways in which a symptom is wholly a subject’s own.<span
class="citation" data-cites="lacansem23"><a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></span> What becomes of interest in
such a text, then, isn’t the meaning of the text but precisely the ways
in which meaning is subordinated to jouissance, and the way the subject
comes into being by way a work of creative artifice of their own
making.</p>
<p>In Hoccleve’s ironic poetic sensibility, too, there is a kind of
cultivated inscrutability: it trades autographical, “empirical” “I”<span
class="citation" data-cites="spitzerI"><a href="#fn56"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a></span> for an “I” much more
particular to its speaker, whose speech is, in a sense,
“autobiographical” but in a way that isn’t above fictionality, personas,
and calling attention to its own unreliability. Hoccleve’s poetic
subjects, in other words, are always <em>supposed</em>, always
half-said.<span class="citation" data-cites="lacansem23"><a href="#fn57"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></span> If there’s something Joycean
about Hoccleve’s <em>Series</em>, his last major “work,” it may not
necessarily lie in the apparent “modernism” of its
self-referentiality<span class="citation"
data-cites="greethamartifacts"><a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref58" role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a></span> as much as in
the particular way he represents the literary subject’s assumption of a
kind of form. In what follows I want to pay attention to the ways in
which the first poem in the <em>Series</em> – “My Compleinte” – supposes
such a form even while it grounds it in a kind of bodily and subjective
fragmentation and formlessness. More specifically, what I’d like to
suggest is that it’s the poem’s reveling in the symptom itself that
provides the script for the emergence of this form. Ultimately, for
Hoccleve, as for Joyce, the subject only comes to assume any sort of
recognizable form as an incessant <em>writing of jouissance</em>, of
which “Hoccleve” is himself a symptom. Also as with Joyce, and in ways
anticipated by my reading of <em>La Male Regle</em> in the previous
section, the way in which this “writing of jouissance” asserts itself is
also particularly phallic, insofar as in Hoccleve writing itself is, to
use Lacan’s phrasing, ultimately offered as the linguistic supplement to
the author’s “little scrap of a dick” that constitutes the phallus.<span
class="citation" data-cites="lacansem23"><a href="#fn59"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></span></p>
<p>A long-standing line of thought in Hoccleve criticism has taken a
particular interest in the ways in which the <em>Series</em> is written
as kind of self-fashioning. Lee Patterson, for instance, uses it as a
point of reference to argue that Hoccleve’s entire oeuvre constitutes an
attempt “to fit the self into a coherent and unifying narrative” in
order to lay claim to a sense of authorial “self-controlled
direction.”<span class="citation" data-cites="pattersonhoccleve"><a
href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></span> Much of this desire to
narrativize a kind of subjective coherence across Hoccleve’s works might
be attributed to the large amount of philological interest his work
commands: as a poet-scribe under the employ of the Lancastrian Privy
Seal, Hoccleve is also one of the earliest poets in English of whose
work <em>autograph copies</em> survive. Critics like James Simpson<span
class="citation" data-cites="simpsonmadness"><a href="#fn61"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></span> and David Watt, in turn,
have emphasized that to read Hoccleve’s work as a coherent whole in the
first place requires accounting for the collection’s self-awareness of
its own <em>wroughtness</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the texts that comprise the <em>Series</em> can be understood
as parts of a coherent literary whole only if the reader imagines them
as part of a coherent material whole (a book made in a physical sense).
Yet no manuscript of the whole <em>Series</em> survives independently.
Paradoxically, then, readers can imagine the <em>Series</em> as a
coherent material whole only if they perceive the story of its making as
a coherent literary whole (a book made in a literary sense).<span
class="citation" data-cites="wattseries"><a href="#fn62"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>More recent “literary” readings of Hoccleve’s work, though, have been
notably less invested in reading Hoccleve’s poetry in order to affirm
its “coherence.” “My Compleinte,” the first poem in the <em>Series</em>,
narrates, in a Boethian mode, the subject’s recovery from an unspecified
mental illness, but as a number of critics have pointed out, the nature,
origin, and status of the illness <em>and the narrator’s recovery</em>
are very much in question. Ethan Knapp has argued that in the poem
“madness is never truly surmounted,”<span class="citation"
data-cites="knappmuse"><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></span> and that “what Hoccleve
actually depicts in the <em>Series</em> are a set of descriptions of
madness that are almost indistinguishable from sanity, accompanied by a
series of proofs of sanity that are ironized and undercut as soon as
they are presented.”<span class="citation" data-cites="knappmuse"><a
href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></span></p>
<p>To read Hoccleve either solely in terms of his (doomed or not)
idealistic attempts to form some sort of “coherent” ego-ideal or for how
cleverly he might ironize any such attempts might also risk glossing
over the gender politics of Hoccleve’s work. Critics like Karen Winstead
have noticed the ways in which the self-referentiality of the
<em>Series</em> to Hoccleve’s earlier work – particularly in the
“Dialoge,” in which the narrator determines to make right with his
female readership after their apparently negative response to his
condescending reworking of Christine de Pizan’s <em>Letter of
Cupid</em>, only to include translations of two blatantly misogynistic
tales in the <em>Series</em> – adds up to a consistent antifeminist
sensibility which hides behind its own irony.<span class="citation"
data-cites="winsteadhoccleve"><a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a></span> Picking up on
this criticism and putting Watt’s observation of the way Hoccleve’s
writing puts the burden of “coherence” onto its readers in a different
light, Julie Orlemanski has read the <em>Series</em>’ “My Compleinte”
and “Dialoge” for how this ironizing tone and mock-penitential task to
redeem himself for his women readers constitutes a move away from the
“pathological quaverings” of the symptomatic body in “My Compleinte” to
the assumption of a masculine identity.<span class="citation"
data-cites="symptomaticSubjects"><a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a></span> As I’ll address
later in this section, though I agree with this reading, I think there’s
an important sense in which this trajectory itself constitutes a symptom
insofar as it’s the assumption of a (sexed) identity as narrativized
here – or, in another sense, the <em>assumption of the ‘I’ itself</em> –
might also be understood as symptomatic. “My Compleinte” marks this
assumption as a symptom not by pathologizing this “I” but by dramatizing
the ways in which it presents a narrative impasse that, tautologically,
can only be resolved by reference to this same “I.”</p>
<p>Something shared between “My Compleinte” and the earlier
<em>Compleynte paramont</em> is the way both poems center a jouissance
of the body.<span class="citation" data-cites="lacansem19"><a
href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a></span> In the <em>Compleynte
paramont</em>, the body is the reference point through which the
alienation of signifiers like “woman” gives way to the insistence of
some other, unarticulable enjoyment at the limits of subjectivity. As
the speaker’s bodily memory of the pleasures of holding her child
imposes itself on her “barren” present, what’s prompted is a kind of
splitting as the subject finds herself at an impasse between her ongoing
attachment to her object – and her faith in God, which is coterminous
with this attachment – and a present condition in which this attachment
would seem to have been irreparably severed. What interests me in the
Marian complaint here is that it’s pre-dialectical: rather than having
yet arrived at some sort of compromise that might allow her to live with
this contradiction, the subject’s integrity gives way to an insistent
jouissance that exceeds her. There’s also a sense, then, in which this
complaint is pre-<em>symptomatic</em>: the speaker has no fetishistic
substitute object to reach for, nor has she found her <em>sinthome</em>
by which she might sustain a writing of this jouissance in such a way
that might allow her to live.<span class="citation"

<p>While the concept of a kind of “split subject” is present in Freud’s
thought from a quite early point, he specifically discusses the process
of the “splitting of the ego” in 1938, describing the child’s response
to finding out that continuing to satisfy an instinct will result in
intolerable danger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is a conflict between the demand by the instinct and the
prohibition by reality. But in fact the child takes neither course, or
rather he takes both simultaneously, which comes to the same thing. […]
On the one hand, with the help of certain mechanisms he rejects reality
and refuses to accept any prohibition; on the other hand, in the same
breath he recognizes the danger of reality, takes over the fear of that
danger as a pathological symptom and tries subsequently to divest
himself of the fear.<span class="citation" data-cites="SE23"><a

</blockquote>
<p>As Laplanche and Pontalis note, what’s new in this account is that it
describes a splitting on the level of the <em>ego</em> itself rather
than between <em>agencies</em> (e.g. between ego and id) that is novel
compared to the classic models of repression and the return of the
repressed. “One of the specific traits of this process,” they write, “is
that it does not result in the formation of a compromise between the two
attitudes present but that it maintains them simultaneously instead,
with no dialectical relationship being established.”<span

role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a></span> While Freud’s privileged
example in the 1938 essay is the fetish – which develops, on his

he might lose his own<span class="citation" data-cites="SE21"><a
href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a></span> – in the <em>Compleynte
paramont</em> the loss of the object would seem to make this impasse
itself into the symptom of Marian complaint.</p>
<p>It’s this relation of complaint to the <em>impasse</em> whereby a
subject doesn’t give up on their desire – even when not giving up on
that desire verges on existential threat to their being <em>while also
not giving up on their attachment to that being</em> – that interests me
in complaint and complainers. While, in Lacanian terms, it’s within this
impasse that we can begin to see something like the emergence of a
dialectical solution to this impasse by way of the
symptom-as-<em>sinthome</em> (as we’ve seen with the <em>Compleynte
paramont</em> and <em>La Male Regle</em>), the mode of complaint doesn’t
itself offer a way beyond this impasse – on its own, anyway. Both of the
earlier poems end open-endedly, demanding a supplement to their
dialectical impasses that must come from the reader herself. In the
<em>Compleynte paramont</em>, this demand finds its expression in the
poem’s generic ending and in the slippage of its second person address
from Mary herself to the reader as her suffering becomes figured not
only as an exemplary sacrifice but as a figure with which the reader is
encouraged to identify with, as the Virgin’s mothering of Christ is put
in explicit comparison of the now-undifferentiated “I”: “For chyld which
that shee of hir body baar / To yeue her tete, as my chyld that heer is.
/ His cote hath torn for your gilt, nat for his, / And hath his blood
despend in greet foysoun, / And al it was for your redempcioun.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="paramont"><a href="#fn72"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a></span> In <em>La Male Regle</em>,
as I’ve discussed, this open-endedness takes a more explicit form as a
<em>demand</em>, as the poem’s symptom ceases to primarily function as a
means of by which a pathological repetition compulsion is organized but
– by way of a complaint about an ongoing financial situation – a
humorous writing of jouissance whose continuation is contingent upon the
reader shoring up the poet’s overdue paycheck.</p>
<p>Complaint, then, is hardly a nihilistic genre even as it doggedly
grounds itself in negative affects. There’s an important sense, though,
in which it unloads a certain degree of responsibility for its critique
onto whoever is willing to listen. In this respect it’s a politically
ambivalent genre, as the offloading of such responsibility can of course
be carried out in a number of ways to a number of different ends.
“Open-endedness” is not the same as “any-endedness.” That said, as I
turn to what is by now Hoccleve’s most famous poem, “My Compleinte,” my
interest lies less with making a claim about the ends to which it opens
the question of its own impasses and their supplements but to provide an
account of how it arrives at them in such a way that might itself
supplement future readings that do engage such questions. “My
Compleinte,” I argue, stages the <em>assumption</em> of an “I” in such a
way that opens the question of its dissolution, but it does so in a way
that reveals itself to never quite enact that dissolution on its own. As
with <em>La Male Regle</em>, then, its mode of jouissance differs rather
fundamentally from the <em>Compleynte paramont</em> insofar as its
speaker reserves a certain attachment to the integrity of his own “I.”
The poem moves beyond the scope of <em>La Male Regle</em>, however,
insofar as it self-consciously <em>stages</em> the way in which that “I”
functions as the poetic subject’s <em>symptom</em>.</p>

<em>Dialoge</em></h2>
<p>The brief prologue to “My Compleinte” begins with an inversion of
that of Chaucer’s <em>General Prologue</em>. Trading the chipper
fecundity of spring for autumnal melancholia, the poem begins with the
death of the summer foliage’s green “lusty freisshenesse”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aftir that heruest inned had his sheues,<br />
And that the broun sesoun of Mihelmesse<br />
Was come, and gan the trees robbe of hir leues,<br />
That greene had been and in lusty freisshenesse,<br />
And hem into colour of yelownesse<br />

data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hoccleve’s language here puts the speaker at the end of a long chain
of seasonal withering, tracing a treacle of decay that creeps its way
from the organic world down into the speaker’s heart. One gets the sense
that the speaker is spoken by his own melancholic affect here, appearing
epiphenomenally in the final line of the rhyme royal stanza as an
accumulation of rot. The speaker relates a sleepless November night,
tossing and turning in bed, vexed by a “thoughtful maladie.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn74"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></span> Like the dreamer in the
<em>Book of the Duchess</em>, the Boethian condition – according to
which “stablenesse in this worlde is ther noon”<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></span> – would seem to
physically weigh down on the melancholic speaker. Here, though, this
weight is expressed by way of a seasonal depression in which the
melancholic symptom is imposed from <em>without</em>, raining down upon
the speaker in a “dark shower” that soaks him nearly to the point of
drowning. “The sunne abated, and the dirke shour,” he writes, “Hilded
doun right on me, and in langour / Me made swymme, so that my spirite /
To lyue no lust had, ne no delyte.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a></span> There’s a sense
of both restlessness and exhaustion in these lines that may be familiar
from <em>The Book of the Duchess</em>, but what’s especially striking
here is that the source of melancholic symptom is already described here
as circumstantial. Melancholia has an external cause, and part of what
characterizes the melancholic’s will is its <em>exhaustion</em> – their
almost physiological inability to continue wading through an atmospheric
sense of weariness.</p>
<p>This metaphorical characterization of melancholic affect in terms
natural world, too, lends itself to a sense of porousness between the
subject’s “inner” and “outer worlds,” almost as if talking about the
weather were itself a way of narrating the subject’s symptoms in a sort
of free indirect mode. But what the prologue ultimately most keenly
seeks to narrate is an accumulation of some sort of tension that can
only be resolved by way of speech:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greef aboute myn herte so sore swal<br />
And bolned euere to and to so sore<br />
That nedis oute I muste therwithal.<br />
I thoghte I nolde keepe it cloos no more<br />
Ne lete it in me for to eelde and hore,<br />

data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s in these lines that the Hocclevean complaint departs from a more
traditionally melancholic discourse. Despite the Boethian and Chaucerian
clichés invoked up until this point, the speaker doesn’t find himself at
the outset expressing a desire to seek solace or consolation for his
ailments. Nor is there necessarily the sense in these lines of some
“lost object” or forgotten cause to his suffering.<span class="citation"
data-cites="SE14"><a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a></span> Rather, we’re told that he
would like to get something off his chest and that there’s a
<em>something</em> that’s been “swelling” within and which can’t be
restrained any longer. It’s as if prior to any expression of affect, the
complaint were a response to an economic question, a way of managing
libidinal tensions within the subject’s psyche.</p>
<p>The body of the complaint begins by recounting that the speaker
suffered a “wilde infirmite”<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a></span> for an

and threwe.”<span class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a
href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></span> He puts a special emphasis
upon how well known this illness was among both people who knew him as
well as those who didn’t: “How it with me stood was in euery mannes
mouthe, / And that ful sore my frendis affright.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a></span> The speaker
describes this illness – or bout of madness – in terms of his mind
having wandered off for a time: “the substaunce of my memorie / Wente to
pleie as for a certein space,”<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a></span> but now, as he
repeatedly insists, “My wit and I haue bene of suche acord / As we
were.”<span class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn83"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></span> It’s his perception among
the “prees” (crowds, public) that is given particular concern in the
speaker’s complaint, as he notes that because during the time of his
ailment he’d been a “rietous persone” and forsaken most of his
friendships, upon returning to his normal life he finds himself suddenly
isolated where he previously hadn’t:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The worlde me made a straunge countinaunce,<br />
 <br />
Wich that myn herte sore gan to tourment,<br />
For ofte whanne I in Westmynstir Halle,<br />
And eke in Loundoun, amonge the prees went,<br />

id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of amicable recognitions, as he walks through the crowded
London streets he finds averted glances and dejected expressions. As the
speaker goes on, these averted glances become increasingly suspect as he
begins to ventriloquize them: “although his savage sickness has
withdrawn and passed for a time, it will return, especially given his
age,”<span class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn85"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></span> he imagines “manie
oone”<span class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn86"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a></span> saying as they pass by him
in the street. In psychoanalytic terms, what the poem traces here is the
transition of the “prees” from a “good” to a “bad” object, as the
absence of a look of recognition gets taken to be a
<em>deprivation</em>, a sign of aggressiveness.<a href="#fn87"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>
As with the earlier weather metaphors, though, what’s remarkable here is
the sense of porousness with which Hoccleve represents mental illness.
His symptoms are <em>outside</em> of his control in a way that also
places them more or less outside of <em>himself</em> and places the
responsibility for the discernment and diagnosis of his illness into the
hands of the other in such a way that calls into question whether his
illness has in fact passed.</p>
<p>This dynamic is underlined by the fact that, since during the time of
his illness his memory had gone to “play,”<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a></span> Hoccleve is
completely reliant on others’ accounts of his illness to discern what
any of its symptoms were. According to these reports, the speaker looked
like a “wilde steer,” casting his eyes in all directions and shaking his
head from side to side.<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref"

role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a></span> Nonetheless, having already
decided his illness to have been simply the result of it being his turn
on Fortune’s wheel to be afflicted with something, the narrator condemns
these judgmental, nosy people who “wiser hem pretende that thei
be,”<span class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn93"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"

conceit here appears self-consciously symptomatic for the unresolved
contradiction in the text that it highlights, as the fickleness of
Fortune is invoked here both to provide an etiology for his illness and
to condemn the nosiness and exaggeration of the same people on whom the
speaker is reliant upon in order to know anything of his illness in the
first place.</p>
<p>Ironically, what all these whispers and rumors (each of which Thomas
keenly and constantly listens for)<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref"

“throw himself outside of himself” anew, as the narrator determines to
police his own appearance and comportment so that he might never be
suspected of madness again. Since nothing he can say in his own defense
can ever be held “worth a leke,” he throws out his “tunges keie” and
keeps to himself whenever in public spaces.<span class="citation"
data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a></span> In what is
perhaps the most remarkable (and remarked upon) passage in the poem, he
begins to scrupulously police his own appearance:</p>

id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The speaker finds himself caught up in a knot of anticipatory,
paranoiac thinking, in which he must prove his sanity to a public which
he imagines already thinks he’s insane, which requires concealing the
fact that he might suspect that he thinks they think that. Particularly
striking is the image of “painting” his “countenance, cheer, and look”:
the subject’s desire to cover up his fragmented affective state (his
now-“frosty cold,” now “fiery hot” heart) requires a <em>creative</em>
act by which he might enact that “jubilant assumption” of an “alienating
identity” that Lacan famously described in his account of the mirror
stage.<span class="citation" data-cites="lacanEcrits"><a href="#fn98"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a></span> In Lacan’s account, however,
the subject <em>invents</em> their own image in a double sense of both
quite literally stumbling upon it by accident in the mirror in an event
that precipitates an active <em>identification</em> with that image.
Here, though, the mirror is consciously <em>consulted</em> to check upon
an image which has already been characterized as having been “painted,”
as if to confirm the ongoingness of the speakers own identification with
his “ideal-I.”</p>
<p>One fairly obvious reading of the way Hoccleve stages this mirror
scene would be to point out that this paranoid relation of self to self
that compels the speaker to performatively re-enact his own assumption
of a particular image of himself – in a sense, to will his own sanity –
itself calls into question the integrity of that image and soundness of
that assumption. In Lacan’s telling of the mirror stage, which of course
describes a moment very early in childhood development, the assumption
of an “I” is coterminous with the resolution of the subject’s fragmented
sense of their own body such that the coherent gestalt that the subject
anticipatorily takes up appears almost to have been “predestined.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="lacanEcrits"><a href="#fn99"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a></span> In this sense, the “I” is
itself a symptom: on the one hand, it’s a hallucinated image, one which
functions to protect the subject from their own – “real” – incoherence.
On the other, though, it’s also in a quite literal sense invented by the
subject herself, whether it’s when the child discovers their own image
in the mirror or when an adult makes a decision to assume a particular
countenance and gait. What’s most striking about Hoccleve’s mirror
scene, though, is that the narrator’s self-image <em>survives</em> all
these compulsive glances he makes into the mirror every day: the
cultivated appearance holds up. In an important sense, the narrator’s
“painted” appearance is <em>successful</em>, implying that its
cultivation has a certain truth value and integrity that precedes its
creative summoning. The “I” is a “symptom” precisely insofar as what it
presupposes is “inexistent,” but which, in this same presupposition, it
“marks out its place;” it <em>produces</em> a kind of truth.<span
class="citation" data-cites="lacansem19"><a href="#fn100"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a></span></p>
<p>It’s here where it becomes clear that Hoccleve’s representation of
his own unreliability and subjective fragmentation might be a bit
misleading. For a moment, Hoccleve would seem to be calling his own
practice of cultivated sanity into question when he observes that even
if time and again the image he encounters in the mirror is one in which
there surely “is nothing repreuable / To hem that han conceitis
resonable,” he observes that most people would seem, he assumes, to go
about their days without giving their own painted countences so much as
a thought.<span class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a
href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a></span> Rather than undermining his
sense of his own integrity, though, Hoccleve insists that his being
<em>forced</em> to paranoiacally monitor his own cultivated appearance
of sanity is in fact a sign of his moral uprightness: “Sithen I
recouered was, haue I ful ofte / Cause had of anger and impacience, /
Where I borne haue it esily and softe, / Suffringe wronge be done to me,
and offence, / And not answerid agen, but kepte scilence.”<span

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a></span> We are humorously reminded
here that the poem is, after all, a <em>complaint</em>, and this
tongue-in-cheek invocation of the narrator’s own martyrdom serves as an
ironic reminder that the complainer’s critical gaze is one that always
ultimately looks outward while leaving the integrity of the complainer’s
ego intact. It’s also at this point in the poem that its repetitive
structure starts to become more obvious, as the narrator once again
reproaches the “prees” for being so judgmental. He wonders, for
instance, why he even bothers going to work at the Privy Seal anymore,
given that everyone seemingly still just thinks he’s a ticking time
bomb.<a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a> This is followed by another
increasingly unconvincing injunction against judging people by their
appearances and the reminder that “commvnynge is the beste assay” of a
person’s integrity.<span class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a
href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a></span></p>
<p>What I’d suggest is that the scene to which “My Compleinte”
ultimately can’t stop returning to is the scene of complaint itself.
What’s interesting about Hoccleve’s invocation of Boethian and
penitential conventions in the poem is that rather than immediately
generating more metatextual layers, it has the subject neurotically
revisiting the same scene of frustrated sociability over and again. It’s
when the narrator seems to sense that this repeated elaboration on his
complaint coming to an impasse that he begins (after a brief and
somewhat precious digression about his long-suffering social condition
leaving him with no more options but to give away all of his possessions
and “crepe into my graue”)<a href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref105" role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a> to finally settle
into his ultimately unconvincing solution, which is that his illness was
a <em>gift</em>. The speaker reaches this conclusion by way of a
borrowed book, in which another complainer is exhorted by a
prosopopoeial Reason to accept suffering with grace.<span
class="citation" data-cites="elliscomplaint"><a href="#fn106"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a></span> In a characteristic but
somewhat baffling gesture, Hoccleve actually includes a translation of
the passage of the dialogue from this book that has provided him with
consolation, but cuts it off at the point at which he actually
<em>stopped reading it</em>, since the friend from whom he borrowed it
took it back: “Lenger I thoughte reed haue in this book, / But so it
shope that I ne mighte naught. / He that it oughte agen it to him took,
/ Me of his hast vnwar.”<span class="citation"

<p>The gesture is striking for how it would seem to self-consciously
reflect on the compositional ethos of medieval bookmaking itself and
incorporate into the poem, treating the confessional register of the
poem as itself subject to the same silent principles of
author-as-collator. Ethan Knapp has discussed these principles in terms
of Hoccleve’s “bureaucratic poetics,” in which “the labor of the Privy
Seal” is projected “into the world of poetic composition.”<span
class="citation" data-cites="knappmuse"><a href="#fn108"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a></span> The speaking subject of “My

punctuated by these kinds of references to the fickleness of Fortune
and, by extension, the apparent arbitrariness of God’s will, the final
consolation that Hoccleve extracts from the borrowed allegorical text

<em>Synonyma</em>)<span class="citation" data-cites="burrowisidore"><a

</blockquote>
<p>It’s a particularly “Hocclevean” conclusion to reach insofar as the
consolation for illness is in some ways articulated in the same terms as
its dysphoric symptomaticity: that is, <em>outside</em> of the subject
in such a way that makes the subject at the mercy of others, the subject
of others’ observations and utterances. The difference, of course, is
that now rather than being torn apart between a “prees” of others, he
now can relegate this symptomaticity to the desire of one “Other.” The
perverse scopophilia of the passage is also striking, as the “gift” from
God is apparently the privilege of suffering for his entertainment.
Here, the function of the consolation isn’t to resolve or work through
the symptom but to <em>make complaint terminable</em> by fostering an
identification with an imagined Other’s desire.</p>
<p>The “Dialoge” complicates this suspiciously tidy consolatory ending.
The first part of the dialogue in question revolves around the question
of whether Hoccleve should continue writing and whether he should share
the text of his complaint. The Friend’s immediate response to reading
“My Compleinte” is to ask Thomas not to let anyone else read it.<a
href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref112"

of his work revolves around the conviction that his having recovered in

id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a> This initial
argument is followed by a familiar digression, though, in which Hoccleve

an extended rant about coin clippers. Unlike <em>La Male Regle</em>,
however, this complaint isn’t the prelude to a <em>demand</em>, but to a
complaint about a more general moral malaise. It’s in this sense that
the poetic world of the “Compleinte” and “Dialoge” is much more
closed-off: their ironic conceits, intertextual referents, and
heteroglossic imaginary ultimately function to fold the poem’s attention
back onto its own composition. The Friend would seem to pick up on this,
and though the concern he expresses about Hoccleve’s illness revolves
around the identification of his commitment to writing his own illness
as itself a kind of pathological symptom, the poem’s solution is
ultimately to foster the continued enjoyment of that symptom.</p>

for hypocritically judging him for something that they are just as
succeptible to under the fickle will of Fortune, coin clippers are a
“bad object” insofar as they devalue the labor of workers by dishonoring
just price:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What distinguishes this fiduciary complaint from that of <em>La Male
Regle</em> is that rather than specifying a debt and making a demand for
its payment, complaint here grounds itself in a more broad-stroked
moralism: that is, in the conviction (shared, if one recalls, by
Boethius in the <em>Consolation</em>) that labor can in fact be justly
compensated and that its devaluing is a <em>moral</em> failure rather
than a dynamic which inheres to the wage relation itself. It’s also,
importantly, not a punch line but a digression: the Friend seems
uncertain as to the discussion’s relevance to his argument and simply
asks if he has any other reasons for wanting to publish his
complaint.<span class="citation" data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a

<p>Hoccleve explains that he also wants to translate an <em>ars

data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></span> conceiving
the work itself as an ascetic act by which he might “cleanse” his soul
“sumwhat by translacioun.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a></span> The Friend
regards this with suspicion, expressing concern that his “bisy

illness and itself a symptom. Just as a thief, he explains, “no dreede

class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123"

is that his mental break wasn’t caused by exhaustion from intellectual
labor but from his (still unspecified) “long seeknesse,”<span
class="citation" data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn124"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a></span> which quietly shifts the
terms of the debate from the nature of that illness to the question of
whether he will become ill again. The friend concedes that the
conversation has already reassured him of Hoccleve’s sanity,<span
class="citation" data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn125"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a></span> and eventually is convinced

<p>It’s with reference to this shift that Julie Orlemanski observes that
despite bringing into question the redemptive ending of “My Compleinte,”
the “Dialoge” ultimately fails to ever offer any “coherent
counteretiology” that might clarify “why he went mad or how his ‘wilde
infirmite’ came to be.”<span class="citation"
data-cites="symptomaticSubjects"><a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a></span> This lends
itself to a sense that the poem simply loses interest in its own
symptoms: Hoccleve and his friend move on to discuss the contents of the
book, eventually concluding that what ultimately needs to be addressed
is his need to repent for having often reserved “greet wyt and lak” for
women in his writing.<span class="citation"
data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a></span> This call to
make amends with his women readers, though, turns on the mocking
observation that women simply cannot take a joke or criticism from men:
“‘The Wyf of Bathe take I for auctrice,’” Hoccleve explains, “‘that
wommen han no ioie ne deyntee / that men sholde vpon hem putte any
vice.’”<span class="citation" data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a
href="#fn129" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a></span> Though the poem ends by
specifying that Hoccleve needs to atone for his mocking translation of
Christine de Pizan’s <em>Epistre Au Dieu d’Amours</em> – a poem which
famously inverts the Genesis creation myth to feminist ends by insisting
that “woman was the first to be / Created in the earthly Paradise, / Not
man”<span class="citation" data-cites="pizancupid"><a href="#fn130"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a></span> – he undermines this in
advance with a misogynistic rant which, too, makes reference to Adam and
Eve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>`Adam begyled was with Eeues reed,<br />
And sikir so was shee by the serpent,<br />
Th whom God seide, “This womman thyn heed<br />
Breke shal, for thurgh thyn enticement<br />

data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tone here is tongue-in-cheek – right on beat, the Friend’s
response is to ask how things are between Hoccleve and his wife.<span
class="citation" data-cites="ellisdialogue"><a href="#fn132"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a></span> As Orlemanski puts it,
though, the poem nonetheless leaves the reader with an acute sense of
having addressed itself here to “the presumptively masculine space of
<em>good</em> readers, who can appreciate the jibes at women’s
expense.”<span class="citation" data-cites="symptomaticSubjects"><a
href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a></span> This would especially seem
to be the case in Hoccleve’s references to his own translation of
Christine – not only does he subtly reject her re-telling of the
creation myth, but in a move that recalls his own backhandedly phallic
avowal of his own castration in <em>La Male Regle</em> he disavows any
ill intent in his translation of the <em>Epistre</em> by cheekily
disavowing his own role as an author: “Considereth, therof was I noon
auctour. / I nas in that cas but a reportour / Of folkes tales.”<span

<p>I would suggest, though, that the trajectory of the <em>Series</em>’
representation of its poetic subject in terms of its assumption of this
“masculine” position which is established at the expense of the
woman-as-other is itself the poem’s symptom. As the mirror scene in “My
Compleinte” and the demanding self-deprecation of <em>La Male Regle</em>
suggest, even when Hoccleve’s poetry revels in the fragmentation of its
own poetic subject – that is, in a kind “jouissance of the body” whereby
the subject’s embodied symptomaticity comes into view in its own
tearing-apart between subject and other – a core element of Hoccleve’s
poetic sensibility is the way in which he constantly ironizes his
relationship to his own texts, always remains, in a sense, one step
ahead of his own self-negation. There is a sense, in other words, in
which its the very staging of this splitting of the subject in
Hoccleve’s poetry that provides the terms and trajectory for the
articulation of that subject in the form of a spoken “I.” Prior to the
articulation of this “I” in contrast to a feminine Other, a shape and a
trajectory for this “I” are suggested when it is articulated against and
through a series of un-individuated others: whether it be the “prees,”
the coin clippers, the flatterers or Hoccleve’s women readers.</p>
<p>The two poems are also of interest for what they do to the complaint
as a genre. What I’d like to suggest is that the frame poems of the
<em>Series</em> call attention to the ways in which complaint, as a
genre, always presupposes a speaking subject in such a way that remains
backhandedly committed to a certain fantasy of that subject’s coherence
by way of the “I,” even if what the layers of ironizing gestures and
kvetching across Hoccleve’s work so often work to call attention to the
tautological nature of this “I.” It’s in this sense that if the
“Dialoge” fails to produce a convincing “counteretiology” to the
consolatory ending of “My Compleinte” that it’s already brought into
question by introducing the interlocutor of the Friend in the first
place, the failure lies outside of the scope of the text itself. The
“failure” is successful insofar as it provides an occassion to continue
writing. It provides the text with its own symptom and in the process
reveals the symptomaticity of the poetic subject itself insofar as it
tautologically aligns the writing of that symptom with the writing of
that same subject.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>What I’ve wanted to suggest in this chapter is that part of what
Hoccleve’s poetics does that distinguishes its theory of the subject
from other texts I’ve discussed in this dissertation is that it
dramatizes the <em>assumption</em> of that subject in a way that doesn’t
take the terms of that assumption for granted quite to the same extent.
In chapter two, part of what I wanted to unpack in Heldris of Cornwall –
by way, in part, of a detour on Boethius – was the way in which “Nature”
functions as an ideological symptom in discourses on sex insofar as with
respect to sex it so often functions as a <em>fetish</em> insofar as its
invocation as a reference point for defining “a sex” covers up the
question of sexuality in such a way that preserves it as a problem.
There’s an inescapable sense, then, in which the invocation of “nature”
in a text like <em>Le Roman de Silence</em> resembles the invocation of
“biology” in contemporary discourses on “sex and gender” (and it’s
precisely this resemblance, I would argue, that ought raise critical
suspicion with respect to both terms).</p>
<p>In the third chapter I introduced the question of the symptom and
attempted to begin sketching out the range of registers in which this
question might be posed. The melancholic subject of Chaucer’s <em>Book
of the Duchess</em>, for instance, brings into the view in which the
symptom rhymes with Freud’s account of identification by way of the
<em>trait</em>, which, as Leo Bersani has argued, itself suggests a kind
of sociability of “impersonal narcissism” through which the recognition
of an “imperfect replication” of myself in the other provides the
grammar for a kind of “solidarity of being” between subjects. The
openness and eroticism of this form of identification is one which,
crucially, preserves an account of difference, however. What <em>The
Prioress’s Tale</em> helps to illustrate is the way in which the symptom
can just as easily be a means of objectification. Chaucer’s tale, in
some respects, calls attention to the ways in which the child often
functions as the symptom of the <em>family itself</em> to devastating
ends when the mode of identification occasioned by the symptom is
predicated on the elimination of difference and, it follows, the
elimination of the subject whose being finds its alienated form of
appearance as the parents’ <em>objet a</em>.</p>
<p>My interest in Hoccleve’s poetics in this final chapter has centered
on the way he articulates the <em>complaint</em>. What makes the
complaint of interest to a larger concern in melancholia is in part the
ways in which it partakes in a melancholic discourse in part by
suppressing that discourse – that is, by both lovingly and
contemptuously walking alongside it. As Lauren Berlant observed, it
remains committed to “belonging to a world” even as it doesn’t take that
belonging for granted – part of its attachment to that world, too, is an
attachment to the <em>work</em> of negotiating that belonging.
Complaint, even when doggedly anchoring itself in negativity, always
presupposes a fantasy of wholeness that it withholds from the Other.
It’s in this sense a deeply narcissistic discourse, but productively so:
it attends to lack, to the shortcomings of the Other, without
sacrificing its love for the Other and in so doing it also, perversely,
marks out the space that its own subject might assume some recognizable
form.</p>
<p>There is an important sense, then, in which the symptom of Hoccleve’s
complaint form is Hoccleve himself, who, as his writing never ceases to
remind us, is a <em>written</em> subject whose referentiality is always
bounded by the text itself. What’s easy to miss in attending to the
fallacies, plot holes, and jouissance of his texts is the ways in which
these inconsistencies constantly take the complaining “I” as their
tautological reference point.</p>

never in fact identical with the “object,” but acts, in a sense, as its
placeholder. Even if this means that it obscures this “true” object, the

desire that exceeds it. It’s in this excess that an enjoyment beyond
satisfaction – an “other jouissance” that comes from outside the symptom
itself – can be said to insist in the subject’s attachment to their
symptom: “I love you, but, because inexplicably I love in you something

107. I put “masculine” and “feminine” in scare quotes to emphasize that
Lacanian psychoanalysis ultimately distinguishes between these positions
in terms of the subject’s relation to jouissance rather than in response
to questions of gender socialization or identification – at least
insofar as the latter is articulated in what Lacanians term the
Imaginary. As <span class="citation" data-cites="carlson2010">Carlson,
<span>“In Defense of Queer Kinships”</span></span> convincingly argues,
however, Lacanians’ preservation of Freud’s normatively gendered terms
even in their de-essentializing re-reading of them may be worth moving
away from in order to better emphasize the ways in which Lacan
understood these roles as <em>functions</em> that aren’t reducible to
either gender identity or biological determination. It should also be
noted, of course, that both the poems in question here are written by
men: if there’s a sense in which the situating of the appearance of this
“other jouissance” in the Marian lyric is “feminine,” it’s in a sense
brought into view by a phallic structure and reference point which it
exceeds and takes as its foil. Rather than somehow undermining the value
of this jouissance, though, I think this only strengthens the case for
the more formalist approach of theorists like Apollon and Carlson, in
which the emphasis on <em>functions</em> and relations can potentially
be more flexible to cultural and imaginary situations in which
often-overdetermined terms like “masculine” and “feminine” may muddle
more than they clarify.<a href="#fnref37" class="footnote-back"
