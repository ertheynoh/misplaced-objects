    <h1>gender and melancholic structure</h1>
      <p>A recent paper by Kris Trujillo on “queer melancholia” observes the
      centrality in queer theory of grief as a generative and subversive force,
      arguing for an understanding of queer theorizing as a practice of both
      endless mourning and “interminable devotion:”</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>It is the posthumousness of literary studies that queer theory
      inherits. In other words, the elegiac mode of queer theory catalyzed by
      the AIDS pandemic sets up a melancholic mourning whose object of loss is
      simultaneously the dead and the very project of queer theory. […] The
      precarity of life is intimately entangled with the precarity of theory,
      which is to say that the devotion to the dead is inseparable from the
      devotion to queer theory. In the end, the convergence of the elegiac mode
      and large-scale grief caused by the AIDS pandemic set the norms whereby
      the posthumousness of queer theory is constantly affirmed – the rituals of
      queer melancholia. But this melancholia is not defeatist.<span

      </blockquote>
      <p>Trujillo affirms the apparently unsecular emphasis on “ritual” in queer
      theory; avowing these qualities, one assumes, is what makes a
      “non-defeatist” melancholia thinkable, since theory on this telling
      “risk[s] stultification for the possibility of engendering resistance
      whose effects are not guaranteed or foreseen from the start.”<span

      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></span> What does it mean for
      melancholia not to be “defeatist?” If mourning were terminable, would
      queer theory still have a purpose?</p>
      <p>Focusing as he does on the first issue of <em>GLQ</em>, an important
      case for Trujillo is Judith Butler’s now-classic essay “Critically
      Queer.”<span class="citation" data-cites="butlercriticallyqueer"><a
      href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></span> In that essay, Butler describes
      queer grief as a work which “render[s] the ungrievable grievable:”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="trujillomelancholia"><a href="#fn4"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></span> since heterosexuality is, in a
      sense, itself fundamentally melancholic insofar as it proceeds on the
      “unconscious disavowal of homosexual desire,” gay melancholia, on
      Trujillo’s reading, “seems to name a state of depression over the way that
      preempted grief for homosexual desire transforms into a cultural
      resistance to mourning queer death.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="trujillomelancholia"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></span> What interests
      Butler in the original essay, though, is not only this depressive
      repetition, but also the question of “resignifiability,” that is, the way
      that performances of gender like drag – by merit of being <em>performances
      of performances</em> – might in the process of reproducing certain roles
      also shake out into view some of the ways in which those roles are
      threatened or subject to change by merit of their own uncertainties. Queer
      performativity for Butler “allegorizes” the “heterosexual matrix,” and in
      doing so it reminds us that what it allegorizes is itself an allegory, a
      fiction. “Resignifiability” comes to us as a surprising upswing in the
      course of the reiteration of “highly invested terms”: “For if to identify
      as a woman is not necessarily to desire a man; and if to desire a woman
      does not necessarily signal the constituting presence of a masculine
      identification, whatever that is, then the heterosexual matrix proves to
      be an <em>imaginary</em> logic that insistently issues forth its own
      unmanageability.”<span class="citation"
      data-cites="butlercriticallyqueer"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></span> Queer mourning, one
      supposes, does something similar by performing the work of grief that
      society refuses to.</p>
      <p>But does Butler’s attention to performativity’s capacity for
      resignifiability still make it “melancholic?” If the assumption of
      (“cisheterosexual”) gender happens upon a necessarily melancholic
      structure of disavowals, then I think it’s fair to ask whether queer and
      trans identifications and modes of enjoyment are also conceivable by this
      version of queer theory except melancholically, as modes of enjoyment that
      refuse to let go of “lost objects” of “normal” heterosexual development.
      We may also ask what it means for “queer melancholia” to “risk
      stultification for the possibility of engendering resistance.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="trujillomelancholia"><a href="#fn7"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></span> At what point does performative
      repetition stultify, and why would it? On these points, it may be worth
      recalling that much of Butler’s interest in the questions of
      resignifiability and melancholy gender comes out of her engagement with
      the work of Sigmund Freud, especially his revised account of melancholia
      in the <em>The Ego and the Id</em>.</p>
      <h2 id="from-pathology-to-structure">from pathology to structure</h2>
      <p>When Karl Abraham first wrote about melancholia, he had initially
      understood it in terms of sexual frustration and disappointment: the
      unconscious latches itself onto some person and doggedly refuses to let
      go. With the 1917 essay “Mourning and Melancholia,” though, Freud had
      begun to notice that the problem of melancholia hinged on questions of
      identification: “In mourning it is the world which has become poor and
      empty,” he observed, “in melancholia it is the ego itself.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="SE14"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span> Here, melancholia
      already appears as a pathology distinct from mourning specifically in the
      melancholic’s identification with the lost object. This identification is
      ridden through with ambivalence: because their identification with their
      loved object also includes its faults and injustices, the melancholic’s
      investment in their object demands of them that they perform a kind of
      balancing act between love and hate, directing violent aggression towards
      their own ego all the more intensely for how much they love the object
      that they’ve unconsciously incorporated.</p>
      <p>In 1923’s <em>The Ego and the Id</em>, Freud relegates this ambivalence
      between object-investment and identification to a much earlier stage in
      the subject’s development than he had previously. While for the young
      child in the oral stage, “object-cathexes and identification are no doubt
      indistinguishable from each other,” one consequence of the division he’s
      now begun to describe between the id and the ego is that as the latter
      develops, the ego’s identification with their loved object may become the
      <em>precondition</em> for the id’s letting go of it. By the 1920s, Freud’s
      topography of the human psyche is defined by division and conflict: the
      dogged refusal to let go of the object is now identified as the property
      of a specific agency that he identified as <em>das Es</em> (latinized as
      the “id” in Strachey’s <em>Standard Edition</em>), which “feels erotic
      trends as needs,” putting the still young and “feeble” ego [<em>Ich</em>]
      in the position of having to choose between acquiescing to the id’s
      demands or repressing them.<span class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a
      href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>While in the earlier work the melancholic’s identification with their
      lost object appeared as a pathology that results from the inability or
      refusal to mourn an object which has been lost, in Freud’s “mature” theory
      the melancholic mode of surviving loss becomes much more fundamental to
      the establishment of the subject’s character. The function of the
      developing ego is to take on the role of substituting itself for the lost
      object in order to appease the “id”:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>When it happens that a person has to give up a sexual object, there
      quite often ensues an alteration of his ego which can only be described as
      as a setting up of the object inside the ego, as it occurs in melancholia;
      the exact nature of this substitution is as yet unknown to us. It may be
      that this introjection, which is a kind of regression to the mechanism of
      the oral phase, the ego makes it easier for the object to be given up or
      renders that process possible. It may be that this identification is sole
      condition under which the id can give up its objects. At any rate the
      process, especially in the early phases of development, is a very frequent
      one, and it makes it possible to suppose that the character of the ego is
      a precipitate of abandoned object-cathexes and that it contains the
      history of those object-choices.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>An important shift has occurred between the Freud of the
      metapsychological papers and now. The earlier account of melancholia is
      more concerned with the discernment of melancholia’s <em>pathology</em> as
      it distinguishes itself from grief and mourning. Now, however, melancholia
      has become a much more foundational subjective structure, a
      <em>precondition</em> for the development of the ego, and one may well ask
      if in the process the ego itself has become an “object” to which we find
      ourselves stubbornly and pathologically tethered.</p>
      <p>What this shift also happens alongside is a more profound
      Oedipalization of psychoanalysis. Freud notes that the outcome of the
      Oedipal conflict – wherein the subject identifies with either the mother
      or the father – is somewhat surprising given the melancholic theory of
      subjectivity outlined above, as the assumption of a gender does not
      apparently occur by way of “introduc[ing] the abandoned object into the
      ego.”<span class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn11"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></span> It does occur, though:
      however, it’s “easier to observe in girls than in boys,” as girls will
      quite often respond to the relinquishing of their father as a love object
      by identifying more strongly with the masculine aspects of their own
      latent bisexuality. Curiously, it’s in such scenes where bisexuality
      becomes most troublesome, though it should be noted that bisexuality is no
      longer the object-indifferent polymorphous perversity of the <em>Three
      Essays</em> but is instead understood as the determinative ground of the
      Oedipal narrative. Since, as a generalizable rubric, that narrative isn’t
      alone sufficient to provide anything other than the terms of
      identification, how the child occupies those terms and ultimately
      identifies as either a boy or a girl is determined by “the relative
      strength” of their “masculine and feminine sexual dispositions.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn12"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>The extent to which those “dispositions” are themselves determined by
      the Oedipus complex or somehow precede it is left unclear, but, as Freud
      tells it, while the Oedipus complex provides the terms and narrative
      structures for the assumption of sex, it doesn’t from the outset determine
      how the subject and their individual circumstances will find themselves
      caught up within those terms. To use his own example, it’s for instance
      entirely possible for a boy to simply pass through the complex as if they
      were a (“heterosexual”) girl and vice versa. This underdetermined quality
      even makes Freud question, for a moment, whether the Oedipus complex is
      ultimately relevant at all in the determination of a subject’s sex: “It
      may even be that the ambivalence displayed in the relations to the parents
      should be attributed entirely to bisexuality and that it is not, as I have
      represented above, developed out of identification in consequence of
      rivalry.” Nevertheless, at least “where neurotics are concerned,” it’s
      safe to assume its presence in the subject’s history.<span
      class="citation" data-cites="freudEgo"><a href="#fn13"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></span></p>
      <p>It’s on the basis of this late formulation of Freud’s that Butler reads
      Freudian theory as a theory of “melancholy gender,” noting that Freud’s
      account provides an emergent account of gender identification that
      presupposes the <em>preservation</em> of the same gender which it
      disavows. On Butler’s reading, the masculine and feminine positions of the
      “heterosexual matrix” supposed by Freud’s account of sexual difference
      maps onto his account of melancholia insofar as heterosexuality requires a
      repudiation of same-sex desire and opposite-sex identification vis-à-vis a
      melancholic incorporation: “it appears that the loss of homosexual objects
      and aims (not simply this person of the same gender, but <em>any</em>
      person of that same gender) will be foreclosed from the start.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="butlermelancholy"><a href="#fn14"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></span> The ego now appears as a
      graveyard of queer identifications, formed by and also conserving its own
      disavowals.</p>
      <p>However, since our disavowals are sustained by love, part of what
      afflicts the melancholic is their own interest in sustaining it, and the
      resistance to completing mourning can be attributed to the fact that we
      can’t bring ourselves to let go of our loved objects. It’s this same
      slipperiness, perhaps, that can also explain the resistance to mourning
      itself, to the denial and affective suppression of the depressive position
      itself. But to <em>mourn</em>, in Freud’s terms, would mean to think one’s
      own splitness, to undermine the certainty against which knowledge and
      identification are measured: it would mean moving beyond the stultifying
      melancholia that accompanies the subject being stuck on its lost objects
      by recognizing and properly grieving those objects. This problematic is of
      central importance to the work of Melanie Klein, for whom the depressive
      position forms a kind of affective reference point for the subject that
      dialectically provides the material for which reparation can be made.
      Klein’s work merits some attention, since, like Butler, her work
      establishes a theory of gender difference that begins from this same
      moment in Freud. Klein’s work maintains a sharper distinction between
      mourning and melancholia, however, and the fact that she, like Butler,
      strongly associates the Freudian ego with gender formation has
      consequences that deserve some scrutiny.</p>
      <h2 id="love-and-pacification">love and pacification</h2>
      <p>In her 1963 paper “On the Sense of Loneliness,” her last, Klein’s
      primary concern is the question of “integration.” On this, Klein’s thought
      is generally divided into three periods. In her early work, Klein takes an
      interest in the young child’s process of integrating their internal images
      of the parents into a mature superego. Following this period is the
      discovery of the “depressive position,” and, with it, the investigation
      into the ways in which, following the early integration of “good” and
      “bad” objects, the splitting of such objects becomes progressively more
      aligned with reality as the child learns to reconcile themself with
      ambivalence. In her later work, Klein’s work with adult schizophrenics has
      brought her attention to the integration of the <em>ego</em> and the ways
      in which “[i]ntegration depends on love impulses predominating over
      destructive impulses.”<span class="citation" data-cites="kleindict"><a
      href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></span> This interest in the
      reparative capacity of love is something which emerges very early in her
      career – such as in the famous essay on symbol formation,<span
      class="citation" data-cites="LGR"><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></span> in which her
      attention to the death driven aspects of subjectivity begins with the
      observation that the schizophrenic child’s “flat affect” can be attributed
      to an overly strong superego, and that the child’s guilt and suppression
      of his own destructive impulses correlates with an inability to form happy
      attachments.</p>
      <p>For Klein, integration is the central “<em>developmental task</em>” for
      the subject, but this doesn’t mean that she thinks that there is any sense
      in which a subject is ever fully “cured” or that splitness simply goes
      away.<span class="citation" data-cites="kleindict"><a href="#fn17"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></span> That some of the more
      understated and quotidian affects like loneliness speak to both to the
      ever-postponed terminability and <em>necessity</em> of “integration” is
      what makes them of such importance to both Klein’s theoretical and
      clinical work. As she observes in the essay on loneliness,</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Full and permanent integration is never possible for some polarity
      between the life and death instincts always persists and remains the
      deepest source of conflict. Since full integration is never achieved,
      complete understanding and acceptance of one’s own emotions, phantasies
      and anxieties is not possible and this continues as an important factor in
      loneliness.<span class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn18"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Loneliness testifies to its own unrequitedness, representing a longing
      for a state of non-contradiction in which difference doesn’t impossibilize
      reciprocity between our inner and outer worlds. Its longing is all the
      crueler for its resemblance to nostalgia, as its glance looks back beyond
      the conservative stasis sought by the drive and into an originating
      fantasy of wholeness that we know we ought to know better than to believe
      in. The “inner sense of being alone regardless of external circumstances,
      of feeling lonely even when among friends or receiving love” – is
      ultimately a “yearning for an understanding without words,” that is, “for
      the earliest relation with the mother.” Klein calls it “ubiquitous.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></span> Loneliness marks
      a disjunction between feeling and unconscious knowledge, it testifies to
      the way our fantasies imprint themselves on our day-to-day reality despite
      ourselves.</p>
      <p>I think it’s this sensitivity to affect that makes Klein’s at times
      crudely allegorical and apparently dualistic interest in the life and
      death “instincts” a bit deceptive. While loneliness testifies to a
      melancholic foundation that grounds the subject’s ego in a kind of
      nostalgic longing, this longing isn’t made out to be foolish on account of
      its unrequitedness – there’s a sense in which it’s <em>necessary</em>,
      since it also enables the capacity for love and enjoyment. Love in this
      sense isn’t simply the victory of one instinct over another but the
      ongoing work that must accompany the rediscovery and reparation of the
      subject’s desire. It’s this “nostalgia” and longing for the mother’s
      breast that enables “enjoyment” in the first place:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>A happy relation to the first object and a successful internalization
      of it means that love can be given and received. As a result the infant
      can experience enjoyment not only at times of feeding but also in response
      to the mother’s presence and affection. […] Moreover, there is a close
      link between enjoyment and the feeling of understanding and being
      understood. At the moment of enjoyment anxiety is assuaged and the
      closeness to the mother and trust in her are uppermost. […] Enjoyment is
      always bound up with gratitude; if this gratitude is deeply felt it
      includes the wish to return goodness received and thus the basis of
      generosity.<span class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn20"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></span></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It’s on this point that Klein moves beyond Freud’s accounts of
      projection and melancholia – which privilege the projection or
      introjection of the destructive impulses of the “death instinct” – to the
      insistence that, at the same time, there exists the “urge of the life
      instinct to find a good object in the external world.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></span> As in Freud, this
      finding is really always a <em>refinding</em>, and the fact that desire is
      structured by a melancholic relation to its loved object means that the
      melancholic subject can discover within themselves the means to mourn and
      repair their own attachments through love.</p>
      <p>Klein’s understanding of mourning and melancholia may be read
      dialectically insofar as love functions as the means for overcoming the
      dualism of the “instincts.” As it does for the philosopher Gillian Rose,
      love for Klein provides a kind of “third” or “middle” term insofar as it
      “arises out of misrecognition of desire, of work, of my and of your
      self-relation mediated by the self-relation of the other.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="roseMourning"><a href="#fn22"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></span> It’s a “work” that is
      independent of its object, but which is also made meaningful in relation
      to that object. It’s in this sense that the Kleinian object (which refers
      to the same “thing” that Lacan refers to when he speaks about the Freudian
      <em>Ding</em>), begins to resemble something like Hegel’s sense of the
      modern <em>law</em> insofar as the “urge toward integration” that is
      propelled by love supposes that this “integration” imply a “full mutual
      recognition” that is both <em>necessary</em> and only able to “be
      approached phenomenologically, […] by expounding its dualistic
      reductions.”<span class="citation" data-cites="roseMourning"><a
      href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></span> Something of this can be seen
      in Klein’s understanding of the ego. There are times in Klein when the ego
      appears as something that one only catches glimpses of within the flux of
      introjection and projection – troubling the neat opposition between the
      “inner” and “outer worlds” that are often spoken of in object relations
      theory, such an ego appears only as movement, never able to be spoken of
      in terms of a discrete “object” or point on a grid.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the ego remains something whose “integration” Klein is
      keenly invested in. The securing of a “good object” in childhood serves as
      a lifelong counterweight to the death-driven parts of subjectivity in the
      libidinal balancing act of integration. Crucially, when the subject
      projects and introjects “goodness” and “badness” of the world, these
      processes</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>are not <em>predominantly</em> related to fragmented parts of the
      personality but to more coherent parts of the self. This implies that the
      ego is not exposed to a fatal weakening by dispersal and for this reason
      is more capable of repeatedly undoing splitting and achieving integration
      and synthesis in its relation to objects.<span class="citation"

      role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></span></p>

      <p>The “object” isn’t “external” to the ego, and the “ego” isn’t an object
      at all but the “thing” that the subject keeps re-finding, it is, itself,
      that which the subject continually falls towards and away from in a
      “comedy” of misrecognition through which it is propelled by desire.
      Importantly, though, the ego <em>survives</em> its misrecognitions: within
      the flux of introjected and projected objects, as it moves through the
      world it manages to find a center of gravity, however precarious. As is
      the case for Rose, the Kleinian subject isn’t simply doomed to their
      misrecognitions and caught forever in projected delusions but <em>is</em>,
      in fact, able to form some sort rapport with the Real. The tenor of this
      process is <em>comic</em> in the Hegelian sense, insofar as part of what
      the approach towards integration entails is the development of an
      awareness of the fact that our objects are in fact <em>subjects</em> –
      other “egos” or “split” subjects implicated by their own
      self-relations.<span class="citation" data-cites="roseMourning"><a

      <p>What useful in Klein’s attention to affect is its sensitivity to the
      toll this inability to mourn has on the melancholic subject themself:
      melancholia is in a sense interminable, but it always contains the seeds
      of its own transition into the reparative, into mourning what has been
      lost so as to prepare the groundwork for new attachments and desires. It’s
      in light of this sharper distinction between mourning and melancholia that
      a notion of “queer melancholia” as a kind of political practice in itself
      appears a bit strange. For even if the psychoanalytic subject’s desire is
      oriented around the continued refinding of its object, around a kind of
      procession from and return to that object and between depression and
      reparation, the shape of this movement isn’t strictly circular: the
      subject’s orientation towards their object is enabling of other horizons
      of desire rather than simply a ritualistic rehearsal of “devotion” to that
      object. Whether such a movement is ultimately “secular” is less of
      interest to me than is the question of what sorts of new attachments and
      desires are both made available and foreclosed when Klein allows this
      allegory of ego and object to provide the terms for her understanding of
      sexual difference, and what it would mean for queer and trans subjects if
      the performance of our identifications can only ever be conceived
      “melancholically.”</p>
      <p>One point Jacques Lacan would later criticize Klein’s theory of the
      “combined parent” and her emphasis on the mother as the site for all of
      the terms of the Oedipal complex – of both the “good” <em>and</em> the
      “bad breast” that provide the reference point for the child’s early
      experiences of splitting – is that rather than doing the apparently
      feminist work of filling in the gaps of Freud’s account and its inability
      to provide a coherent theory of femininity, it instead entrenches just the
      “heterosexual matrix” that, later, queer theorists like Eve Sedgwick and
      Judith Butler would come to criticize in Freud.<span class="citation"
      data-cites="lacanEcrits"><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></span> For Klein, alongside the
      observation of the Oedipal conflict in the infant’s biting and scratching
      at the mother’s breast is the extremely early observation of penis envy
      and primary femininity that <em>psychically locates a melancholic
      structure of sexual difference prior to the development of the
      ego</em>.</p>
      <p>The outcome of this line of thought is an even more rigidly “binary”
      account of bisexuality than can be found in Freud at his most Oedipal.
      What Klein’s interpretation of psychic bisexuality moves towards is an
      account in which sexual difference becomes another refraction of the
      libidinal balancing act of the life and death instincts, according to
      which the acknowledgement and working through of the “transgender” aspects
      of one’s own subjectivity ultimately serves to reconcile a subject with a
      sex that precedes them. Such is the case with a male patient Klein
      describes to elucidate this theory of bisexuality:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>In order to illustrate the difficulties of this particular aspect of
      integration and its relation to loneliness, I shall quote the dream of a
      male patient. A little girl was playing with a lioness and holding out a
      hoop for her to jump through, but on the other side of the hoop was a
      precipice. The lioness obeyed and was killed in the process. At the same
      time, a little boy was killing a snake. The patient himself recognized,
      since similar material had come up previously, that the little girl stood
      for his feminine part and the little boy for his masculine part. The
      lioness had a strong link with myself in the transference, of which I
      shall only give one instance. The little girl had a cat with her and this
      led to associations with my cat, which often stood for me. It was
      extremely painful to the patient to become aware that, being in
      competition with my femininity, he wanted to destroy me, and in the past,
      his mother. The recognition that one part of himself wanted to kill the
      loved lioness-analyst, which would thus deprive him of his good object,
      led to a feeling not only of misery and guilt but also of loneliness in
      the transference. It was also very distressing for him to recognize that
      the competition with his father led him to destroy the father’s potency
      and penis, represented by the snake.<span class="citation"

      </blockquote>
      <p>The degree to which the subject’s latent bisexuality and unconscious
      have been completely saturated with Oedipal signification is quite
      striking: rather than an unruly and polymorphously perverse unconscious,
      we find the dream so saturated with signification that it expresses
      multiple Oedipus complexes at once. If the violence towards the
      snake/phallus appears somewhat as an afterthought in this account, though,
      it’s because for Klein the more fundamental problem is that the patient,
      being male, hasn’t found it within himself to properly mourn “his
      difficulty over the feminine position,” and the unbearable fact that he
      unconsciously wishes to destroy his own “feminine part.”<span
      class="citation" data-cites="EG"><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></span> Here, reparation
      comes on the back of a recognition whose function is to pacify the unruly
      and pathologically non-normative identifications that constitute
      sexuation. Rather than the polymorphously perverse, underdetermined,
      non-procreative sexuality of the <em>Three Essays</em>, bisexuality is now
      <em>legible</em>, captured by a collection of readily interpretable
      signifiers whose allegorical referents can be found in a narrative which
      has been quietly pushed towards being a condition of the “normal.”</p>
      <h2 id="beyond-melancholia">beyond melancholia</h2>
      <p>The problem with this melancholic understanding of gender, at least
      when it comes to thinking non-normative and non-Oedipal modes of
      enjoyment, is that within its terms a subject cannot both repair and
      continue to identify with their “lost objects” in a way that is conducive
      to flourishing. It’s worth asking, then, what a theory of reparation and
      mourning with respect to gender might look like that doesn’t presuppose a
      model of identification according to which the repair of our egos depends
      on the working-through of our perverse desires and identifications in
      order to better abolish them. Any explanation of our “aberrations” that
      seeks to explain our present and future desires and identifications solely
      by way of appeal to its foretelling by our “lost objects” may not be
      sufficient for such an endeavor. I would suggest that trans life
      complicates the attempt to define queerness in melancholic terms, as it
      provides countless examples of subjects who find creative ways to
      negotiate gender’s ambivalence — the ways it occassions both suffering and
      pleasure, as well as the ways gender can be worked into a kind of
      supplement through which melancholic stultification might be overcome.</p>
